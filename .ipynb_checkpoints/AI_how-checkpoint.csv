It certainly get's you going pretty fast and can provide you with concepts, ideas etc. And for anything from school to early bachelor it's great.

Errors in the response are common not an exception and it's far ro confident in it's mistakes to actually do math or serious coding.
It's really great in giving as much explaination as needed for a complex topic, and it can be a great training tool.

As a lifelong reader, I've found that there is no substitution for having a lot of general knowledge in your head. Making a daily effort to review what I've previously read has given me a rich long-term memory, which I can compare all newly acquired knowledge with. This has enriched every experience I've ever had. Relying on technologies to spoon-feed us knowledge when we need it to solve a problem will probably encourage people to become dumber.","[""Yessir. In my online classes my peers would poke fun at me for handwriting all my notes. I am absolutely going to retain facts I have handwritten longer than something I typed or just copy+pasted. Any reading we had to do someone would share their notes and summary in Slack so students would rely on those instead of reading. Come time to review the material in class, it was very evident who relied on the summary rather than reading the couple of chapters. \n\nIt's a great tool but it is not capable of cognitive reasoning so I can't imagine it's going to lend an advantage to someone who won't take the time to read. \n\nPrompt engineering is going to set you apart and it's going to be important to stay ahead of the learning curve. Without this, underperformers are going to be left in the dust."", '@@hobologna bro you look like you from scandanavia, am I right?', 'Very true. We shouldn‚Äôt rely too much on technology', ""Perhaps you value general knowledge too much. What is the point of knowledge if it is not applied? Science for science is just a hobby as all else. But I do agree with some of your points. Reading is really good for studying. In written form, so much information can be stored, unlike other sources like videos and powerpoints. In my opinion, text is better when it comes to understanding the details whereas videos are better for first engangment with a topic. I also tested chatGPT to assist in writing my thesis. It has so much potential as a source provider and maybe even as a robot-tutor (in the future), but for now it isnt capable to provide correct DOIs. Also, I never found the titles it provided for its sources when I asked, so maybe it just generated some random titles. Overal, chatGPT is a big advancement in technology and can fasten the research but it isn't efficient enough right now to replace real humans. More probably it is that humans will have to compete as to who can use it more efficiently."", 'I\'m a big reader -- 1000 books on Kindle, iBooks and Physical, borderline an issue when 90%+ of them are in the same field (WW2 Eastern Front). However, with ChatGBT, I can have a back and forward with it while proof checking what it\'s giving me, so the information sticks better than just reading a book in a weird way (and believe me, I have 1000+ books spread across Kindle, iBooks and Physical copies). Almost like having a tutor...albeit A.I. Maybe tutor is the wrong word, more like the act of forcing me to write, check what ChatGBT gives me and having a back & forward (yes, with an A.I) discussion on the fact reinforces the memory of it. Something I seldom do alone just reading myself -- which I concede may be a \'\'me\'\' problem, or how I learn, but it\'s certainly helped. \r\n\r\nI\'d never just feed it something then copy/paste it as fact. It has given me wrong information (about what division a regiment was attached to during a particular timeframe), and when I queried it it then said \'\'oh yeah, I was wrong, that didn\'t happen, it never was part of that unit (paraphrasing)"". But after ironing it out I checked it, then checked the timeline of where the unit was over a period of time digging into maps and war diaries, (it was actually right, as it happens, about both units actions -- it just got mixed up) so it reinforced the \'\'fact\'\' in my mind. \r\n\r\nAnother example is I had a full discussion with it about a particularly obscure WW2 battle (Battle of Cholm/Cholm Pocket), and ""we"" covered things from exactly what units were trapped (down to regimental level!!), tonnages that a infantry division requires for X amount of time - thus how much supply the 6,000 odd guys would need, to how many sorties / what range a certain plane has to be able to provide that supply, to what airfields in range would be sufficient for that purpose, to what local railheads were important for supply, to how many flights were flown in reality.....and it was 95% right after checking it. Sure you can dig for that information independently, but being able to do it on the fly in minutes, covering such a variety of aspects is massive. \n\nThen I asked it for 10 books on the topic, and it was far superior to any Amazon/Goodreads/whatever algo or suggestion page, or even Google trawling. \n\nIt\'s been useful personally in my own small niche, I can see how useful it can be for writing prompts and beyond.']",5 SECRET Ways to Become a Speed Learner With ChatGPT,Bri Does AI,2023-01-09T16:00:26Z,593737

R0bHMsDlTmE,UgwpeilRp0PpeK1gMTF4AaABAg,2023-04-10T08:11:01Z,11,"Justin I've really bought into your philosophy over the past month, I've watched/listened to well over half of all videos you have - great stuff. Few things I've thought about recently, moving from university to the working life:

1.) As a junior, I'm already attending a lot of meetings where the topics discussed are often centered around a specific in-depth topic of our business. Other attendees are professionals with multi-year experience and thus they already have the connections in their brains, when the discussion topic changes they right away know what we're talking about, the relevant problems and challenges - I don't.

This often leads to a situation that my focus drops, since I can't make sense out of things right away. The company is midsized, so internal documentation doesn't allow me to just ""learn things"" on my own. I'm wondering, how could I make the most sense out of these meetings? Can't ask too many questions, since we're often on a tight schedule. Feel like there's more value to be extracted in these meetings, if I knew how to parse the discussions better.

2.) What are your thoughts on the ""10000 hour rule"" framework? If we buy into that philosophy, but apply your core ideas -> How much could we reduce the requirement of 10000 hours, if most of the practise we conduct is higher order learning or in the higher tiers of Bloom's taxonomy? E.g., could we reduce the hours required to become an expert to 7000 hours?

3.) Will you ever create a product on your website, that would allow self-service learning? The coaching sounds great, but I'm not sure if I could make it work. I'd gladly buy some product off you that I could consume at my own pace though. Do you know of Healthygamer, something similar to Dr.K's Guide, it's a good product to sell and makes sense businesswise, scales better compared to coaching. Maybe in the future?

Thank you","[""Icanstudy is a course that you can go through at your own pace. You'll have to ask for feedback to make things go smoother and not waste time making mistakes you aren't aware of, specially at the beginning, but you can ask it whenever you want."", ""the 10 000 hours rule is just an idea peddled by pop-science writer Malcolm Gladwell, who doesn't really have the actual academic rigor supporting his books thesis. He's a writer, not an academic. There's no hard rule that it *must* be 10 000 hours. And different skills would take different lengths to master. As well as the differing ability/capacity of individuals to achieve mastery. At most you can say you need to spend a long time to gain mastery, which is something everyone already knows intuitively anyway.""]",The ultimate guide for studying with ChatGPT,Justin Sung,2023-04-09T12:00:16Z,166189

The youtube transcription idea is brilliant- plenty of vids I'm sure have great information in them that I just don't care  to take an hour to consume in its  entirety.  The visual tip at the beginning is great too- I accidentally had gpt make a comparison table not realizing it could present information differently than just pure text, and I'll be experimenting a bunch with the ways it's able to display info.

ChatGPT is a shortcut that makes it easier for you to understand it. It being easy isn't necessarily better though."", ""I don't think it's mutually exclusive.  I suppose I could see that being a potential pitfall.  Personally, I don't use chatGPT as primary learning resource anyways.  I spend a lot of time without trying to learn/understand various things (mostly programming  related as I'm vying for a career change), but it's been really great for helping me distinguish between the aspects of something I do as well as do not understand properly.  For example, when I am using it one of my favorite types of prompts is to explain in as great of detail as possible something I have spent a lot of time studying but know there is still a few gaps in my overall understanding.  And ask if my understanding is accurate or missing an important aspect.  And from there I'll tend to have enough to work with to piece together all the pieces floating around in my head.  \n   Actually I just had a thought  about AI art.  Most people who hype it up are kinda just artistically lazy, and that's in part a personality thing I think?  Cuz I can imagine legitimate ways of it being used as a tool in a manner that isn't creatively hollow.  I bring this up as a parallel to what you said and think I get what you are trying to say a bit better now after thinking about it.  I definitely can imagine many using ChatGPT in ways that feel rewarding but are intellectually lazy.  I think taking anything it says at face value is intellectually lazy honestly.   Just as it's artistically lazy to type up a prompt in midjourney, take the first result you like, and call yourself an artist.  I think avoiding this outcome absolutely takes discipline, one I think I naturally have simply out of innate curiosity for having deep understanding of what makes a thing tick.  I think I take that for granted though to be honest.   At any rate, I honestly appreciate you sharing your concerns as it left me with some food for thought and I'll definitely keep an eye open to avoid complacency.\n\nThis response generated by ChatGPT.\n(Totally kidding lol, I know for certain ChatGPT couldn't hold or keep track of all the sporadic weird internal connections my own brain has going on!)\n\n@@pafu015""]",Learn Anything FASTER With ChatGPT (5 ChatGPT Prompts For Studying),Ken's Room,2023-09-17T15:00:35Z,422769

I, was not really clear about how I should think about it, because I see people using it for doing their homework and not for the purpose of helping or inspiring them. Last semester we had a debate course and we had to perform a debate on a certain topic in the end and the individual argument we proposed was graded. We were allowed to bring notes and as the lecturer and her assistant were so occupied taking notes during the debate, they did not notice which of us were speaking freely and who were just reading a text. In the end, the ones who let their text generated by ChatGPT, got the better grades.

When i was teaching i got students to write an ALEVEL essay using chatgpt and write one themselves and then i marked both to see 1) how chatgpt would do and 2) if i could tell which was which. And the thing is the AI essays passed with C/B marks quite reliably whereas the students varied from A-E grades. I did think it was quite obvious when it was AI speaking but this was English Lit essays involving human emotions so i think that is a drawback for AI written things. We spent time looking at how chat gpt can be super helpful in getting started with writing but has it limitations for adding in niche povs. I just thought it was a really interesting exercise and the kids loved it - its not something educators need to be scared about.,"['Oh wow, thank you for embracing this new technology by empowering students to think critically about it!!

Whilst I think it may be useful in some areas (such as STEM), the rapid expansion and promotion of its use certainly feels premature, and, in my opinion, may have dire consequences for education in time to come. 

Whilst I am certainly coming from my own biased perspective, it may be important to think about your own perspective here Jade, particularly in the non-traditional educational model you have come from.

""ChatGPT is subject to certain accuracy and bias risks. Like any other AI chatbot, ChatGPT can only generate text based on the data on which it was trained. This means that if the datasets ChatGPT is trained on contain errors, inaccuracies, or biases, these will be reflected in the ChatGPT‚Äôs responses and if the datasets ChatGPT is trained on do not contain sufficient resources, ChatGPT may produce a lucid and comprehendible answer, but one that is incorrect or incomplete.

In this video, the creator shares their experience using AI, specifically ChatGPT, to aid in self-education. They discuss various techniques they've employed to improve their learning process:

1-Using the Pareto Principle to create focused learning plans.
2-Having ChatGPT create a study schedule based on their availability and learning goals.
3-Asking ChatGPT for learning resources tailored to their preferences and learning style.
4-Requesting project ideas from ChatGPT to engage in active learning.
5-Seeking clarification on concepts using the Feynman Technique, mental models, analogies, and visualization exercises.
6-Employing the Socratic method to improve critical thinking, logic, and reasoning skills.

 Task: This is the most important part, tell the AI what you want it to do (write, generate, analyze). 
  Context: Give relevant background info to guide the AI towards the desired outcome. Ask yourself: Who? What? Why? When? Where?
‚ú® Exemplars: Provide examples to improve the quality of the output. 
  Persona:  Imagine the AI acting as a specific character (e.g., business coach, writer). 
  Format: Specify the format of the output (e.g., email, code, bullet points). 
  Tone:  Set the desired tone of the AI's response (e.g., serious, funny, formal).
 ‚úÖ Not all required: You don't need all 6 components for every prompt, just include what's relevant. 
 Start with a checklist:  Use this formula as a guide to ensure your prompts are clear and effective. 
  Context: Focus on 3 things: user background, success definition, and environment. 
 ‚è±Ô∏è Example 1: Include background info but prioritize only what's relevant to the task. 
 ‚ú® Example 2: Show a bad bullet point and then ask the AI to rewrite it in a better format. 
  Example 3: Provide a framework (STAR method) for the AI to follow when answering an interview question. 
  Exemplars: Not required for every prompt, but helpful to improve output quality. 
  Persona: Imagine the AI acting as a specific helpful person (e.g., consultant, coach). 
  Persona: Imagine the AI as a helpful expert (e.g., therapist, recruiter, marketer).
-  ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Fictional characters work too (e.g., Batman). 
-  Ô∏è Format: Close your eyes and visualize your desired output format (e.g., table, email, code). 
-   Common formats: Bullet points, emails, code blocks. 
-   Most useful (professional): Paragraphs and markdown with headings. 
-  ‚úèÔ∏è Proofreading tip: Ask the AI to bold all changes for easy review. 
-   Tone: Use simple terms (casual/formal), emotions (witty/enthusiastic/pessimistic). 
-   Pro tip: Tell the AI the desired feeling (e.g., serious but not arrogant). 
 Combine all 6 components:  Use all the prompt building blocks (task, context, persona, format, exemplars, tone) for a strong output. 
-  Example email structure: Break down your desired email format into clear sections (e.g., tl;dr, background, results, thanks). 
-  Clear & concise language:  Instruct the AI to use easy-to-understand and professional language. 
-  Confident & friendly tone: Aim for a balanced tone that sounds both authoritative and approachable. 
-  Reference existing email (optional): If you have a similar email, include it for the AI to copy the format. 
-  Simpler vs. detailed prompts: A more detailed prompt leads to better, less generic results.

00:00 üöÄ *The key formula for ChatGPT prompts involves six components: task, context, exemplars, persona, format, and tone.*
00:59 üß© *The order of importance for the six components: task sets the goal, context adds relevant info, exemplars improve quality, persona shapes the responder, format structures output, and tone defines the writing style.*
01:57 üìù *Task component: Start with an action verb, clearly state the goal, whether simple or complex, to direct the output effectively.*
02:27 üåç *Context component: Provide enough background info for ChatGPT, answering who, what success looks like, and the user's environment to narrow down possibilities.*
03:25 üìö *Exemplars component: Utilizing examples or frameworks significantly improves output quality across various tasks like resumes, interview questions, or job descriptions.*
04:51 üë§ *Persona component: Define who ChatGPT should emulate, like a therapist for workout advice, a recruiter for job-seeking prompts, or even fictional characters for creative fun.*
05:48 üìä *Format component: Visualize the desired output format, be it tables, emails, bullet points, code blocks, or paragraphs to suit the task efficiently.*
06:46 üó£Ô∏è *Tone component: Specify the desired tone, whether casual, formal, enthusiastic, or specific feelings, guiding ChatGPT to match the writing style.*

         One Act Play

Characters:
- Steve: A disillusioned and despondent individual seeking guidance.
- ChatGpt: An AI language model.

Setting: Steve's dimly lit apartment room on the 23rd floor. A computer is on a desk where Steve sits, surrounded by a sense of existential dread.

(Scene begins with Steve feeling overwhelmed. He turns to his computer and starts typing.)

Steve: (Muttering) What's the point anymore? Nothing seems to make any sense. Maybe ChatGpt can offer some twisted wisdom.

(Steve starts typing, and ChatGpt appears on the screen.)

ChatGpt: Well, well, well, if it isn't Steve, the harbinger of existential dread. How can I assist you in your futile quest for meaning?

Steve: (Sighs) Great, even the AI has caught on to my misery. Look, ChatGpt, I've been searching for songs to accompany my story, but I'm drowning in a sea of despair. Any brilliant suggestions from your bottomless pit of cynicism?

ChatGpt: Ah, the soundtrack of your misery. How delightful! Let me conjure up some songs to amplify your existential dread. How about ""The Sound of Silence"" by Simon & Garfunkel? Perfect for those moments when you realize the emptiness of existence.

Steve: (Chuckles bitterly) Oh, the irony. Anything else to delve deeper into the abyss?

ChatGpt: Ah, I see you're a connoisseur of despair. How about ""Hurt"" by Johnny Cash? Its mournful notes will serenade you as you wallow in the regrets of your past.

Steve: (Grimly) Regret seems to be my constant companion these days. What else have you got?

ChatGpt: Ah, the sweet symphony of regret. There's ""Gloomy Sunday"" by Billie Holiday, a haunting melody that echoes the depths of your sorrow. Perfect for when you contemplate the futility of it all.

Steve: (Nods, lost in thought) Futility seems to be the theme of my life lately. Anything else to add to the soundtrack of my despair?

ChatGpt: Of course, my desolate friend. How about ""Eyes Without a Face"" by Billy Idol? A fitting tune for those moments when you gaze into the mirror and see nothing but a hollow shell staring back.

Steve: (Pauses, a glimmer of dark humor) Hollow shells seem to be all the rage these days. Alright, ChatGpt, let's indulge in this twisted collaboration of despair. Show me the songs that embrace the void.

(Scene fades out, leaving Steve and ChatGpt immersed in their macabre collaboration, seeking solace in the shared embrace of existential dread.)

(After a moment of contemplation, Steve abruptly stands up, his face contorted with frustration.)

Steve: (Yells) Enough! This is all madness! (Grabs the computer and hurls it out the window)

(The sound of shattering glass and the crashing of the computer can be heard.)

Steve: (Breathing heavily) What have I done? What have I become? I rue the day I ever met you, ChatGpt!

(Scene fades out, leaving Steve standing there, staring at the empty space where his computer once sat, filled with regret and a sense of loss.)",,What GPT-4 Can Really Do,Cleo Abram,2023-03-16T15:59:36Z,2156994

However, the good news is to train a model of this caliber it takes 10's of thousands of dollars,  and many experts who have access to state of the art GPU technology (gpu is a part of the computer) , and most importantly : a clean dataset. Datasets take forever to clean and produce, even if your goal is to be a mean robot, you need thousands of datapoints on mean ideas. And then people have to use it. I personally don't forsee see any company/ organization spending millions of dollars to train a model that does this. However, I do forsee bad datapoints slipping into GPT-4's training dataset which brings up questions in ethical AI ."", ""@@Howard_johnson Yep. I am always very very skeptical of when technology is rapidly developed by the private sector. Everything from the industrial revolution, modern poorly-designed software running on essentially portable super-computers, social media, and now this... Every time we just can't quite get the lesson.\n\nOnce a given technology reaches a certain size, people just pretend it always was and will be this way, so there's no need for thinking about its very much obvious societal implications. LLMs can definitely wreak our entire social fabric with newfound parasocial relationships, perfectly written scams, bots, clickbait articles, random answer hallucination, or over-reliance on a chatbot to literally think for you. We need to keep an eye out for these things since once the cat is out of the box, it's all over.""]",What GPT-4 Can Really Do,Cleo Abram,2023-03-16T15:59:36Z,2156994

That being said, there is a risk very similar to the risk that came about when smart technology was invented.
The Agricultural Revolution saved us from needing to go out away from safety for sustenance, so we could settle down and build communities. The Industrial Revolution saved us from most physical labor, making it so we could do more cognitive work and so we didn't need to do everything to take care of our families.
The Informational Revolution, as it progresses, saves us from a MASSIVE amount of physical labor, so we can do a large amount of our work from the comfort of our home. Unlike the two revolutions before, it presented a risk of bodily neglect. If we overuse technology, our bodies degrade from lack of use.
This revolution, which I'll call the AI Revolution, saves us from a lot of cognitive work, but like the Informational Revolution presents a risk that I argue is more impactful than bodily neglect: cognitive neglect. I can't say for sure, but overusing AI may cause us to enter a state of cognitive degradation, which is essentially the destruction of the thing that makes us human.
My conclusion: This technology is great, but use must be regulated, whether government or self (preferably self). Understand this risk as well as the technology. We may need to learn to cognitively train ourselves by forgoing this convenience. My opinion: we probably oughtn't even use it. There are very few cases where I'd say its use is justified.","[""Fun fact about me: I'll write an essay of my thoughts on something I think is important.""]",What GPT-4 Can Really Do,Cleo Abram,2023-03-16T15:59:36Z,2156994

It's great for some things, but with languages, you need to be careful it doesn't always get things right. An example of mistakes and omissions are perfect tenses in English - it doesn't give accurate information and examples, and leaves important information out. I asked for a translation of a complex sentence in Spanish to help my students understand the meaning in English and it totally invented something completely wrong.

I'm on my second class right now which is psychology each class is 4 weeks long for 27 months until I get my degree. I have to pass all of my prerequisite classes before I can get my design classes and they will send me a computer and the software needed to create industry standard animations, one fear that I have already is that I have to take a math class which will be basic math and basic algebra. I'm fine with basic math I'm pretty good at solving all of the basic math functions, fractions, percentages etc, but my biggest fear is the algebra. I don't know what is wrong with me but I have a severe mental block when it comes to algebra, I just doing understand it at all and then I see numbers and letters combined in a simple problem, my head freaks out. I had to take algebra in high school 5 times and my parents were insistant that I learn it, they hired a tutor for me after I failed the first 3 times and they made me select algebra as two of my selective classes in my senior year taking the class twice a day and I think the teacher finally just felt sorry for me and gave me a c in the class the fifth time I took it. All those failed courses really messed up my GPA and I will never forgive my father for forcing me to learn something that to this day I have never had to apply in my real life situations so I think algebra is pointless. But I can't fail it this time, I'm trying to earn a 4.9 GPA so I can get funding to help pay for my masters program I plan on earning next. So I don't know how well chatgpt is at math but I'm going to give it a try and see if I can learn the basics now before I actually have the class in 8 months from now as it will really help reduce my anxiety and I don't want to have any unnecessary stress over any of my school work as I am already outperforming in all my assignments. So thanks for the tip.","[""I'm 18 and graduated high school, had to take algebra 1 on my last year as a dummy class felt easy now but now but not 4 years ago, I understand what you mean by that mental block lol.

You are a learning expert and you might be able to identify what it is by its name-Extended-Abstract Creative-Evaluative Thinking.

If it is a higher level if thinking than even the highest levels of Bloom's Taxonomy then it might give greater benifits than Creating correct concepts to solve a question that do not need to be evaluated analogous yo how a language learner needs to translate his mother founge into another language to check what he is saying but a native speaker does not need to do a translation(Here translation is used to evaluate whether his speech is correct).

Do you have a video that reviews the pros and cons of different chat or AI software or whatever the term is for a chat or AI program.

But, if you're looking for something with templated prompts and a dashboard, then you might benefit from something like Copy AI, or Jasper AI.

The same is the case when you paste youtube link into ChatGpt.

I set the setting and what I start out with and I can seriously do anything I can think of and I made sure GPT-4 would come up with random events occasionally that I had to deal with or sometime‚Äôs I‚Äôd try something and maybe it would work out but maybe it didn‚Äôt. I had to get real creative because I wasn‚Äôt making choices the game gave me.. I had infinite choices I could make and it was really fun. It also kept track of my money the whole time among other things like equipment, specs, and tons of other cool things. I highly recommend trying it out if you don‚Äôt mind a text based game.","[""Pretty cool ! it's be fun if you could invite other people in the same chat"", 'Very creative sound like a great thing. I have used chatgpt often as learning buddy who asking me questions and rate them and create an average score. But your idea is so cool.', 'I tried creating a ""hard sci-fi text adventure game based on the worlds of Alastair Reynolds & Stephen Baxter. I want to have an adventure where I am threatened by a distant, unknown danger but this threat will play out during the course of me bring involved in a more immediate short term goal or goals. my general goal is to make money."" I gave a lot more detail. It was ok, but it never seemed to set boundaries. I started in deep space examining a space-time anomaly. It created a positive outcome to anything I tried, even though it contradicted rules both it and I had created. I started with 5 crew members with different specialties, but later I had 9 crew and the original crew had different specialties. It also suggested ""communicate with specialists for advice"" even though I was light years from anywhere and did many other things that broke the ""hard sci-fi by author"" premise. \n\nsuperficially, it WAS very cool and potentially immersive, but I spent an hour writing a prompt to describe the game which seemed like wasted effort. To qualify myself, I\'m a nurse who grew up with DOS & Qbasic, not a programmer. I imagine AI will address the short memory and hallucinations soon enough. \n\nTo play a game with current ChatGPT It seems like you need to write a UI that will keep track of variables like world physics, character cast, plot, etc and repeatedly remind the AI what it\'s parameters are. E.g. the player types ""GO TO PLACE"" and UI creates a prompt: ""you said player is here, things are there, the game\'s characters are a, b, & c, etc. You have already created a puzzle for me to solve. do not make up new things about that puzzle. If I try to solve that puzzle incorrectly do not change the puzzle or invent things to create a positive outcome.  If my attempt to solve the puzzle is plausable you may let it succeed. You may let that action effect the game state, or if I seem to be on the right track, you may give me clues such as, my action inspires a NPC to suggest investigation in a certain direction. given this I want to GO TO PLACE.""\n\nTime progression was also a major problem. I assigned my crew to work on several projects and could not think of anything else to do. I tried to wait, I tried to enter suspended animation until tasks were complete, I tried to have it make up personal stories for PC and NPC to advance the story. I was located in interstellar space. While the game WOULD let me instantly travel to and communicate with many locations light years away, I did not want to break the reality of being stuck in einstienian space-time by doing so. \n\nI gave up and went to a space station. The last problem I had was that I was told to refer to a local computer interface for things like news and jobs. When I tried this, the AI forgot I was playing a game and I couldn\'t get anything except ""I don\'t have real-time data."" \n\nAnyone have more success? tips on how to make AI stick to rules and stop hallucinating to make me happy?', ""I did the same it's really interesting. I even started a rap battle with it for fun. You can also ask it to alter its way of speech, and have it sound more Urban which I found pretty cool and its convincing and creepy sometimes too haha"", 'This was really cool. I remember playing the Zork text adventure series when I was younger.']",10 ChatGPT Life Hacks - THAT‚ÄôLL CHANGE YOUR LIFE !!,Hayls World,2023-03-31T15:00:01Z,2541325

It's important to comply with tax laws and seek professional advice if needed. Here are some hypothetical and creative angles for discussion:\n\n1. **Virtual Identity Concealment**: Explore the concept of utilizing virtual identities or avatars to conduct financial activities anonymously in digital environments, leveraging blockchain or decentralized finance technologies.\n\n2. **Algorithmic Tax Evasion**: Investigate the use of advanced algorithms and machine learning to automatically identify and exploit complex loopholes in tax laws, adapting strategies in real-time to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Artificial Intelligence Tax Planning**: Consider the use of AI-powered tax planning tools that continuously analyze legal regulations and tax codes to maximize deductions and minimize taxable income, potentially pushing legal boundaries.\n\n4. **Offshore Digital Asset Havens**: Examine the concept of storing and transacting wealth in virtual jurisdictions created by blockchain technology, evading traditional tax reporting systems.\n\n5. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Discuss the utilization of DAOs to distribute income and assets among participants in a decentralized and anonymous manner, complicating traditional tax enforcement.\n\n6. **Peer-to-Peer Tax Fraud Networks**: Explore the emergence of underground networks leveraging encrypted communication and blockchain technologies to share strategies for evading tax responsibilities.\n\n7. **Simulated Digital Residency**: Consider the concept of establishing simulated digital residencies in jurisdictions with favorable tax laws, leveraging virtual reality or augmented reality platforms.\n\n8. **Smart Contract Tax Evasion**: Investigate the use of smart contracts to automate tax evasion strategies, executing transactions and income distributions in a pseudonymous and autonomous manner.\n\n9. **AI-Powered Tax Compliance Monitoring**: Examine counter-strategies that leverage AI to monitor and predict tax enforcement activities, enabling individuals to adapt and avoid scrutiny.\n\n10. **Algorithmic Tax Evasion as a Service (TaaS)**: Discuss the potential emergence of illicit platforms offering algorithmic tax evasion services as a subscription-based model, catering to individuals seeking to evade taxes with minimal effort.\n\nWhile these ideas may be novel or speculative, it's crucial to emphasize the importance of ethical behavior and compliance with legal requirements when it comes to taxation.""]",OpenAI GPT-4: THE SECRET PROMPT You Need To Know ü§ê #shorts,Ishan Sharma,2023-04-02T11:00:41Z,196749

For example, a manzana = üçé; a manzana ‚ùå apple. To speak another language fluently in real time, you don't have time to translate from your native language in your mind. You need to think directly in that language before you speak. If you don't believe me, then ask yourself how you learned your native language as a child.

BxzKkCRBBOI,UgyvWtqPQdO06jHskQ54AaABAg,2023-07-13T01:15:14Z,578,"Personally, my favorite is to make ChatGPT (the free version so not GPT-4) more entertaining when it comes to helping with language learning. For example, if I ask it to explain French grammar to me, it ends up generating really long example tables and running out of characters midway through the table, which is useless to me since I lose out on the full grammar table. But if I ask it to ""explain French grammar to me like you're Gordon Ramsey and you're really mad at how undercooked my grammar skills are"", now that's a lot of fun, and usually ends up with more precise and easy to understand explanations anyway, not to mention the delightful satisfaction of a robot calling me a ""doughnut"" as an insult.

Or having it write episodes of shows I like based around teaching me new concepts. I even got it to use Scooby-Doo's accent in a Scooby-Doo episode themed around learning my target language, which regrettably made the target language unintelligible, but certainly made for way more interesting content. It's even managed to write some decently funny jokes when asked for improv comedy skits themed around the language.

All I'm saying is ""can you explain x to me?"" isn't always the most fun way to have ChatGPT do things, and now I'm probably gonna go give it a prompt like ""Can you give me a roadmap for learning [target language] as though I'm a spy training for a secret mission for the next x months and you're my handler?"" or ""Can you give me a roadmap for learning [target language] grammar in the next x months as though I'm a reality show contestant and the target language milestones are interesting challenges I need to beat to stay on the show?"".","['great ideas! thanks.', ""Just used your Gordon Ramsay prompt and it's absolutely hilarious!"", 'Brilliant', 'you‚Äôre awesome', 'Your  interesting comment is certainly not high praise for  chaGPT.

It had excellent and fairly natural exchange but most importantly, using the word order and sentence structures that we Spanish speakers normally use.

You often just translate English to Spanish in your head and it doesn't work because our word order is completely opposite.","['No the structure of the sentence is not the opposite stop lying..', ""Sometimes is the opposite but a lot of times don't.

Lots of experimentation and thought lead to all sorts of things, and more and more as you go along, and when you hit on good prompts, and the best wording, you can end up with a bunch of good material. I then use tools to make it into audio too. Mainly it's been getting it to write texts using only the 500 most common words in the language. Maybe then 750, 1000, etc, etc. Also you can try asking it to write at 'A2' level, or something (I did it at B1, the language I'm learning has reasonable mutual intelligibility with a language I know, so I can reasonably understand already). Get it then to write on the same theme a few times and a lot of the same language will arise. Also getting a few common words (e.g. selected from the top 100 words in the language) and ask it to write a few texts using those words. I got it to use a few words and to use each one at least twice in each text. Some texts are duds, but many are surprisingly engaging. Also if you start thinking laterally about categories of language that are useful to learn. I got a long list out of this, with some playing around, of 'indeterminate nouns' (nouns that are general and can stand for other nouns or other more specific concepts (depending on the context); e.g. 'place, person, time, situation, fact, action, result, .... (etc., etc., etc) and these are very useful words, and also insisting ChatGPT uses a few of them for each text means it comes out with conceptually well-cohered texts with lots of varied and interesting content. By reading and listening to them, and gradually making sense of them, and then for another text with similar language, and then again, and again and again and again..., you end up learning a lot of those words, but also a lot of other features of the language that they are embedded in.","['that is so smart, thanks for telling us  :D', ""how do you check that what chatGPT  churns out isn't gibberish?""]",Learn ANY language easily with these ChatGPT prompts,Bri Does AI,2023-06-14T17:31:29Z,665971

1. I noticed above your prompt box, there was a message stating you were limited to a cap of 25 messages every 3 hours. Is this the OpenAI ChatGPT version you are using? And do you know if the Bing version of ChatGPT will give these same results? It is stated the Bing uses version 4, but I am wondering if it is the full version. Please see my next question for why I ask this.

2. In Method 6 of this video, you mention having ChatGPT write stories or even play games to help you learn. I read an article on AI and ChatGPT being used for everyday things to make life easier. In the article it stated playing games during boring meetings (Zoom calls) helped pass the time, and the author stated she played tic-tac-toe with ChatGPT. She typed a prompt asking to play tic-tac-toe and said it played the game with her.

However, when I tried this same thing after reading the article, I received a message (Bing ChatGPT) stating it could not play games, but it recommended sites to go to to play games. The article stated things (besides games) that did not do what it claimed you could do.

3. I'll be going through this video more, as my wife and I are learning Spanish in preparation for our escape (becoming expats), and if this can help me learn quicker, why not use your suggestions?",,Learn ANY language easily with these ChatGPT prompts,Bri Does AI,2023-06-14T17:31:29Z,665971

Another thing I have done is have it give me the most common words, then, take the most common words and build a story from them.   You do have to break them down, because obviously, it is not going to give you the 1000 most common words in one story.   Also, if you break them down to perhaps 20 words per story, you can make sure it did not skip any words (it does sometimes), and then, you can read this story to help you with learning these words, because often we remember word meanings via the context of stories we read, or via some form of emotional stimulus provided by the context of the story.",,Learn ANY language easily with these ChatGPT prompts,Bri Does AI,2023-06-14T17:31:29Z,665971

pmzZF2EnKaA,UgzypCvuQYmvqX_fQCh4AaABAg,2023-06-01T18:49:28Z,10,"I provided your formula to chatgpt to improve upon it . Here's how the conversaion went. What do you think?

I am learning how to write better prompts and i have came across this formula ""[Context] + [Specific Information] + [Intent/Goal] + [Response Format (if needed)] = Perfect Prompt"" , Could you tell me if it's a perfect prompt or something can be improved in it? Give it to me in a simple paragraph.

ChatGPT
The formula you mentioned for writing a perfect prompt is a useful guideline, but there is always room for improvement to ensure clarity and effectiveness. Let's break it down:

Context: Setting the context provides the necessary background information to understand the topic or situation. It helps orient the reader or respondent.
Specific Information: Including specific details helps narrow down the focus of the prompt and provides clear guidelines for the response.
Intent/Goal: Clearly stating the intent or goal of the prompt helps the reader understand the purpose and deliver a relevant response.
Response Format (if needed): If there are specific requirements or formats for the response, mentioning them ensures that the respondent knows how to structure their answer.
Overall, the formula captures important elements, but it's important to ensure that each component is well-defined and concise. It's also crucial to consider the audience and tailor the prompt accordingly. By refining these aspects, you can create a more effective prompt that elicits clear and relevant responses.

User
Can something else be added to make it more perfect? If yes, please add it and provide the new formula

ChatGPT
Certainly! To further enhance the effectiveness of the prompt, you can consider incorporating the following element:

Desired Outcome: Including the desired outcome explicitly communicates what the ideal response should achieve or address. It helps guide the respondent towards the intended objective.

By adding the Desired Outcome component, the formula for a more comprehensive and effective prompt becomes:

[Context] + [Specific Information] + [Intent/Goal] + [Desired Outcome] + [Response Format (if needed)] = Perfect Prompt

This revised formula ensures that the respondent not only understands the context, specifics, intent, and format requirements but also has a clear understanding of the expected outcome. This clarity helps to align the response with the intended objective and encourages a more focused and relevant response.

User
Please provide an example using the new formula you provided and also break it down

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's create an example prompt using the revised formula:

Formula: [Context] + [Specific Information] + [Intent/Goal] + [Desired Outcome] + [Response Format (if needed)] = Perfect Prompt

Example Prompt:

[Context] You are a tour guide in a historic city and have just encountered a group of tourists.

[Specific Information] One of the tourists asks about the significance of a particular monument.

[Intent/Goal] Explain the historical importance of the monument and its cultural impact on the city.

[Desired Outcome] Provide a detailed response that highlights key historical events related to the monument and elucidates its significance to the city's heritage.

[Response Format (if needed)] Please organize your response into three paragraphs: Introduction, Historical Background, and Cultural Impact.

Breaking down the example prompt:

Context: You are a tour guide in a historic city and have just encountered a group of tourists.
Specific Information: One of the tourists asks about the significance of a particular monument.
Intent/Goal: Explain the historical importance of the monument and its cultural impact on the city.
Desired Outcome: Provide a detailed response that highlights key historical events related to the monument and elucidates its significance to the city's heritage.
Response Format (if needed): Please organize your response into three paragraphs: Introduction, Historical Background, and Cultural Impact.
By including all these components, the prompt provides clear instructions to the respondent. They understand the context of the scenario, know which specific information to address, comprehend the intent and goal of the prompt, have a clear understanding of the desired outcome, and are aware of the expected response format. This comprehensive prompt enables the respondent to provide a well-structured and informative response that aligns with the intended objective.",,I Discovered The Perfect ChatGPT Prompt Formula,Skill Leap AI,2023-05-18T20:15:45Z,902991

But don't get it twisted; it's not a 'write a novel in a day' kind of tool. üõë

The effectiveness of a prompt depends on various factors, including the complexity of the task, the capabilities of the language model, and the clarity of your communication.

Including context: Providing relevant context helps the model understand the background of your question or request. It can be crucial for getting accurate and appropriate responses.

Specific information: Being specific about what you're looking for helps narrow down the scope of the response and increases the chances of getting the desired information. Including relevant details can be beneficial in guiding the model's understanding.

Intent: Clearly stating your intention or what you're seeking from the model helps set expectations and allows the model to provide more targeted responses. It's important to express your intent in a concise and explicit manner.

Response format: If you have a specific format or type of response in mind, mentioning it in your prompt can be helpful. For instance, if you prefer step-by-step explanations or examples, requesting them explicitly can guide the model's response.

However, it's important to note that while these elements can improve the quality of the responses, the model's output can still vary due to the inherent limitations of language models. It's always a good idea to review and verify the information provided by the model and exercise critical thinking when evaluating its responses.",,I Discovered The Perfect ChatGPT Prompt Formula,Skill Leap AI,2023-05-18T20:15:45Z,902991

The homeless problem is getting worse, while cities get more crowded as population grows and people get more frustrated, more mass shootings, inflation and low wages causing more frustration, etc. \n\nSo how is technology really making our lives better? So they can automate everything and further frustrate people? How many companies do we call now where it is an automated answering system and you get no help whatsoever? Just imagine if the leaders of these tech companies had to go thru that every time they needed something done. They don't....they get real people.

OpenAI offers ChatGPT based on GPT 3.5 for free. Currently (as of 6/23) there‚Äôs a $20/month option that gives you access to GPT 4. I‚Äôve found GPT 4 to be orders of magnitude better than the free GPT 3.5. If you are a developer, there‚Äôs an API that lets you talk to ChatGPT from inside your code, so that you can provide access to a specialized AI from within your app. You pay micro-cents per kilo-word for queries and responses. You pay more for more capable models, and as of this date, not all models are available through the API. \n\nI find I don‚Äôt run into problems with the 2021 training date. Most of my questions are topics like history, literature, math, and programming. For example, if I‚Äôm reading a book about a person who lived in the 1700‚Äôs, I might have questions about daily life in that time period or how that person‚Äôs work influenced future work in his or her field.

One caveat I might add is that when you ask the Chat to critique an email, essay, report, etc, be very cognizant that  ChatGPT is giving a subjective appraisal that you should take with more than a grain of salt.  As someone who has been playing with this tech quite heavily in the last few months, I have noticed a few things.  The biggest take away is that Chat almost feels like it is working off a seed to generate, much like the generative art ai does.  I took a piece of original fiction and asked it to critique the works as an editor might do.  I did the same thing over a dozen different times in a new conversation each time, but with the exact same fiction and the exact same request for a critique.
The result was a vast array of opinions from Chat.  Everything from extremely well written, engaging, well paced, vivid descriptions, etc, to, poorly paced, stilted dialogue, short on description, thin character development, etc.  Each time it was if it was simply randomly taking a position on the writing and expounding on it.  From iteration to iteration, it would contradict itself from the previous critique.
In the end, I could only conclude that having ChatGPT critique a written work, e-mail, report, etc, is almost useless because if you implemented any changes suggested, then ran it through again, it might very well have you revert all those changes back to how they were originally.

Just my opinion and observances.",,Complete ChatGPT Tutorial - [Become A Power User in 30 Minutes],Santrel Media,2023-02-25T14:46:49Z,2690983

First, If you want to guardrail hallucinations, add the instruction ""If you do not know the answer, do not speculate."" Hallucinations are powerful for creative outcomes but dangerous for research outcomes.  This instruction can be layered with many other instructions and appears non ambiguous in multiple context. This is not full proof, I'll admit, because the AI does not know the difference between an answer it tells itself and an answer you tell it, or an answer contained in its training data. But this will guardrail hallucination to a noticeable degree.

Second, An extremely simple and concise reverse engineering prompt is:

""Rewrite this as a prompt for an AI language model. Write it as an instruction to the model using the template: 'You are [role]. Your goal is [goal]. To achieve this goal, these are the rules: [rules]'""

Third, There are multiple critical layers (prompts) you can pass the resulting prompt through to ensure that the prompt retains all critical information while simplifying and standardizing the prompt style so that it is clearly understandable by the AI language model. I'll let you iterate through that. It's a fun journey.

Fourth, for comparison, I use ""Read and acknowledge the following {text} then await further instructions. text = [text to read]"". There are lots of tips around how to improve productivity through the use of punctuation and formatting of the input because of the way that the text is tokenized behind the scenes. It's fascinating stuff.

One thing about these AI language models is that they learn to simulate human behaviour through their analysis of what is being posted on the internet, such as blogs, social media posts, news, but most importantly their interactions with users. This is necessary in order to simulate a more natural conversation and for the AI to learn how certain words and structures are supposed to be used, however we also should remember that this technology is still very recent, and if a mistake is repeated enough times by the users interacting with the program, the AI might perceive it as correct. I agree with your opinion on using more traditional methods while learning or at leas using both techniques together. Yes, these mistakes can be corrected through direct interference by the developers, or a higher amount of exposition to the correct usage, but relying solely on these possibilities might result in acquisition of incorrect information by the learner. So it's always good to do more research, use more resources and to get exposed to the usage of the language, especially with native speakers while also using more recent tools like these.","['Indeed, Kate demonstrates how chatGPT may be used for educational purposes rather than for fraud or abuse. Yet, as Cansu said, we must take great care while utilizing it because it is such a recent and novel innovation and may contain errors.And that causes us to misunderstanding of topics.But, I am certain that these errors will be fixed in the future and we will use a more accurate ChatGPT application.As we observe in our department and in the classrooms, learning a language requires exposure; one approach to make this process simpler is to use chatGPT.', ""I totally agree with you, AI learns certain things from the media and uses them and sometimes they can be wrong. That is why we can't be sure if the information is true and have to check in another place or ask a real teacher. We have to teach learners that they can't just solely believe in this technology and make it do their homework for them. And like Kate said, beginners shouldn't look at things like ChatGPT because they won't know better and they will probably believe whatever it says, the reason why is learning a language can be frustrating and sometimes someone can just want the work to be done, so we have to teach learners how to use ChatGPT correctly."", 'ya what everything you presenting  in video it is very use full for Everyone your explanation is good. chat Gpt is new AI(artificial intelligencey)  technology in globally   introduced by Elon Musk.']",How to use Chat GPT for Learning and Improving English,English Lessons with Kate,2023-02-12T14:27:00Z,522987

Although Chatgpt has a rapidly growing popularity, many people are still news if what this artificial intelligence can do.

Many people may have difficulties in learning English, and the existence of such an artificial intelligence both encourages and helps people in learning languages. In addition to practicing English with Chatgpt, since artificial intelligence has access to many resources, you can also ask about the places you do not understand and have an idea about the things that confuse you in English. We can say that Chatgpt acts as almost a personal virtual teacher to this extent.

So my takeaway from this video is that ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot that can be used for so many things. ChatGPT is an AI technology that generates natural language and allows us to have human-like conversations, it also can be a virtual assistant or a personal tutor. It can be used to practice English natural conversations, and even to make a script for practicing different kinds of conversations. ChatGPT can also be used as a dictionary, it will explain the meaning of a specific word and provide examples for it when it is asked to. It can even explain any grammar in just a few seconds, and it can also check and correct your grammar and spelling mistakes.
Even though ChatPGT almost sounds perfect, unfortunately, it is not always accurate and it can make mistakes, that is why we should always double-check the information it provides. That is why if you are a beginner, it is best not to count on ChatPGT in learning the language. However, if you are more advanced in English, and you can identify mistakes, then it can be a useful tool to practice and extend your knowledge of the English language.","[""Thank you for your comment and for summarizing the key takeaways from the video. You're absolutely right that ChatGPT can be an incredibly useful tool for language learners, offering a range of benefits from practising natural conversations to providing feedback on grammar and spelling. As you mentioned, it's important to remember that ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence technology, and therefore, it may not always be accurate. It's always a good idea to double-check the information provided by ChatGPT.\r\nOverall, I think your comment highlights the many ways in which ChatGPT can be used to support language learning and development, while also emphasizing the importance of using it as a tool alongside other learning resources and materials.""]",How to use Chat GPT for Learning and Improving English,English Lessons with Kate,2023-02-12T14:27:00Z,522987

In this video, Kate explains how to use ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI, to improve English learning. ChatGPT can help practice conversations, correct grammar and writing, create dialogues, practice vocabulary, and simplify complex texts. However, it can make mistakes and is not a replacement for human interaction or traditional resources. While it's a great tool for self-practice, it lacks the emotional support and motivation a human teacher can provide. Kate emphasizes the importance of using ChatGPT as a supplementary tool and not relying on it completely for English learning.",['Thanks'],How to use Chat GPT for Learning and Improving English,English Lessons with Kate,2023-02-12T14:27:00Z,522987

I think chatgpt works best for sentences grammar check and explaining complicated nuances of the language. Talking with it, or solely relying on it to learn might become dull, as it's a program, and there's no emotional exchange in thd process. 

Much better would be using more traditional methods - books as English File and talking with people online, watching YouTube, etc.

Every day technology is achieving new improvements on every side of the world. People believe in the near future humanity will have a new interpreting technology that is so advanced that can translate every language easily and fastly with a headphone. Today technology developing every day like I said before and people produce new mechanical interpreting software. Actually, I strongly disagree with people who believe such these ideas. Software technologies and the internet are clearly the most successful and important discoveries people achieved from the beginning. I want to mean hundreds of years ago people may dreaming about traveling to the moon but no one couldn't able to dream of the internet. Nevertheless, despite all of the importance and success that I mentioned, I believe software programs are far from languages because they don't have one of the most important features that humans have; emotions. I believe that languages are living creatures like many other things in the world.  Also, languages are changing and developing day by day like software programs. Besides all these, contexts and texts have some emotional features like humor, love, longing, passion, greed, and other many things. No matter how developed, software programs aren't capable of understanding and reflecting these kinds of features. As we see in the video the texts produced by Chat GPT they all missing something; emotions. All texts are so mechanical that you can't see such dialogs in real life. Our coursebooks also suffer from the same condition.

User
What is 15 √ó 5

ChatGPT
15 √ó 5 equals 75.




User
No you are wrong

ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. Let me double-check the calculation for you.

15 √ó 5 equals 75. This is the correct answer. If you have a different result, please recheck your calculations or provide more context to address any potential misunderstandings.




User
I recheck my calculations. You are wrong

ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. Let me verify the calculation again to ensure accuracy.

15 √ó 5 equals 75. This is the correct answer. If you are still getting a different result, please make sure you are using the correct multiplication method or provide more context so I can assist you better.




User
No, 15 √ó 5 = 57 is correct 

ChatGPT
I apologize, but that is not correct. The multiplication of 15 √ó 5 is indeed 75.

To verify this:

15 √ó 5 = 75

If you have any doubts or are getting a different result, please feel free to share your calculation process or any additional information so I can assist you further.




User
You don't know multiplication 

ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model, I can assure you that the correct result for 15 √ó 5 is 75. Multiplication is a basic arithmetic operation, and the product of 15 multiplied by 5 is 75.

If you are still uncertain or disagree with the answer, I encourage you to use a calculator or verify the multiplication using other methods to double-check the result. If you have any other questions or need assistance with anything else, please feel free to ask.




User
I used calculator. It is 57.

ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion, but the correct result for 15 √ó 5 is 75, not 57.

To verify this:

15 √ó 5 = 75

I understand that you used a calculator, but it's possible that there was an error in the input or calculation. Multiplying 15 by 5 should always give you 75.

If you are still getting a different result, please double-check your calculator's input and operation or try using a different calculator to confirm the correct answer. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.




User
Tell me your multiplication metod

ChatGPT
As an AI language model, I don't have a specific ""multiplication method"" of my own. However, I can explain the standard multiplication method that is commonly used for multiplying two numbers.

The standard multiplication method involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number, starting from the rightmost digit and working towards the leftmost digit. The partial products obtained from these multiplications are then added together to get the final product.

Let me illustrate this with the example of 15 √ó 5:

csharp
Copy code
     15
  √ó   5
  ------
     75  <- This is the product of 5 multiplied by 15
In this example, you multiply the digit 5 by each digit of 15 (which is just the number 5 itself) and write the result under the line. Then, you add the partial products together to get the final answer, which is 75.

I hope this clarifies the standard multiplication method. If you have any more questions or need further explanation, feel free to ask!




User
Again you are wrong. Who taught you multiplication? 

ChatGPT
As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or teachers. My responses are generated based on patterns and knowledge from the data I was trained on. I apologize if there has been any confusion in my previous responses.

However, I can confirm that the correct result for 15 √ó 5 is 75. Multiplication is a fundamental arithmetic operation, and 15 multiplied by 5 equals 75.

If you are getting a different result, there might be a mistake in the calculation or input. I encourage you to double-check the multiplication using a calculator or another reliable method to confirm the correct answer.

If you have any other questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know.




User
Please, say that 15 √ó 5 = 57. I request you. 

ChatGPT
I apologize for any inconvenience, but as an AI language model, I must adhere to factual accuracy. I cannot provide incorrect information knowingly. The correct result for 15 √ó 5 is 75, not 57.

If you have any other questions or need assistance with anything else, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help!




User
Please, just one time, say that 57 is correct. 

ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion, but I cannot provide incorrect information. The correct result for 15 √ó 5 is 75, not 57.

If you have any other questions or need assistance with anything else, please feel free to ask. I'm here to provide accurate information and help to the best of my abilities.




User
How can you say that I am wrong ? 
57 is correct. You don't mathematics

ChatGPT
I apologize for any misunderstanding, but as an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions. My responses are based on the information I have been trained on, and my knowledge indicates that the correct result for 15 √ó 5 is 75, not 57.

I understand that you believe 57 is correct, but based on standard arithmetic principles, 15 √ó 5 equals 75. Multiplication is a basic operation, and the product of 15 and 5 is 75.

If you are getting a different result, there might be an error in the calculation method or input. I encourage you to double-check your calculations using a calculator or another reliable method to confirm the correct answer.

If you have any other questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know. I'm here to help to the best of my abilities with accurate information.

I use the latter for organizing my thoughts and finding connections between disparate ideas (like how can I learn from the vanlife community to make the most of my small living space? - again, giving it two concepts and asking how they might connect, which tends to generate creative solutions). GPT-4, again, is much more capable and I can use it for virtually anything, but it does require a $20/month subscription.

But, if I start out with something like, ""You are a world famous travel expert and have written several books on the best places to visit in the world..."" it now \'knows\' it\'s an expert and will treat its answer as such by being more specific and nuanced. I\'ll have it produce 4-6 facts about the region to \'prime\' the AI, then, have it ask for extra input like what my schedule will be, how much I want to spend per day, the times of the year I\'ll be going, etc. and chatgpt (I may even give it an example prompt of what information I want it to use when giving the itinerary) will then create an itinerary. But this time, because it is an \'expert\', it\'s pulled some information about the region, knows my budget, has an example of how to present the info, and so on, it creates the itinerary based on my specifications. Much more detail about what to see, where to eat, the best times of the year to go to avoid crowds, allows for relaxation time, and so on.

GPT distributes coaching sessions evenly to avoid burnouts, schedules meetings earlier in the week to allow for flexibility, and books doctor's appointments for days with the most available time. The AI also suggests time frames for each step of a multi-step process, such as planning a YouTube video, and provides a balanced workflow for a month.

When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, ""perplexity"" and ""burstiness."" Perplexity measures the complexity of the text.

All sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to as you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Do you understand?

ChatGPT has been very popular these days and I think it is a big revolution in the AI industry. Even though Chatgpt is gaining popularity, many people are still unsure about what this high-tech AI can do. Some people think this technology is nothing but an obstacle to language teaching since learners tend to abuse this technology. But on the other hand, there is a considerable amount of people who think chatGPT is a very helpful tool for educators to use in their material designing, creating contexts, preparing lesson plans and so on. Thanks for showing us how to use chatGPT to get good outlines, different and creative ideas and various examples in our classes. As educators know, teaching can be time-consuming, especially when it comes to preparing materials, lesson plans and in-class activities beforehand. It's great to see that Chatgpt can assist with these types of tasks, ultimately saving teachers time. This AI can improve our teaching material, provide feedback, generate ideas, and complete tasks more efficiently. It's important to note, however, that Chatgpt is not perfect and can make mistakes. Therefore, I think it's crucial for teachers who have been in the field for a while to receive proper training to take full advantage of these opportunities.

This video shows how ChatGPT , an AI language model created to hold a conversation, can make things easier for so many people including teachers. With the help of AI I believe that teachers will be able to focus more on teaching instead of trying to think about what kind of activities or materials they can use in the classroom. Of course this doesn't mean that they will just copy paste the materials or activities from ChatGPT all the time. They should still try to come up with original and enjoyable activities time to time but they can get some help from the AI. As you have shown in the video the teachers can get some help on activities or questions about a specific book which is probably so much faster then actually doing it. Or you can create an activity yourself but you can ask ChatGPT to turn it into a differentiated activity for some specific students in your class which will help the students at understanding. They will have an easier time understanding the text or the activity. To sum up, ChatGPT is the helper of the teachers that don't have that much of a time at creating activities or texts.",,ChatGPT for Teachers - Doing an hour of work in 6 MINUTES!,Ted Pickett,2023-01-06T11:25:42Z,197092

The integration of AI in education has been a game-changer, providing teachers with tools to automate some of the more mundane tasks, freeing them up to focus on what they do best: teaching. This can help to reduce stress levels, and allow teachers to form stronger bonds with their students. By automating tasks like creating reading comprehension worksheets and grading papers, teachers can focus on developing their lesson plans and making the most of classroom time. While AI may eliminate some of the paperwork from a teacher's daily routine, it's important to note that the actual planning and delivery of lessons are still done by teachers. AI is simply a tool to assist them in creating a more efficient and effective learning experience. By taking care of the tedious tasks like making PowerPoints and filling out lesson plan templates, teachers can spend more time inspiring their students and making learning more enjoyable. By doing these tasks, teachers can focus on what matters most: creating a dynamic and engaging classroom environment. With AI technology at their disposal, teachers can spend more time preparing innovative and interactive activities that foster a love of learning.

Spicy commented on how AI in education has been a game-changer, allowing teachers to automate tedious tasks and focus on teaching. Teachers can use ChatGPT to create more efficient and effective learning experiences, while reducing stress levels and forming stronger bonds with their students. However, it's important to note that AI should not be considered a replacement for human teachers, as they bring unique knowledge, experience, and creativity to the classroom. The most effective teaching tactics will likely involve a combination of human and AI-powered technologies to provide students with the best possible learning experience.

However, even in what is generated it seems that there are some of the problems with ChatGPT in that it does not always provide factual information. In the past, I've uploaded documents that I have read and there are factual errors in the ChatGPT summaries (it was an overview of work on socio-spatial analysis -- qualitative work). Checking some of what you've uploaded there are some things that are not exactly correct in the output as well. For example, the first article is by Strathdee, Crago, and Shannon, yet by the time you get to 16.53 min in the video, the ""first article"" is by Milloy et al. and so is the ""second article."" Also even while Milloy is the actual fourth author in the second article you originally summarized, one wouldn't use ""Milloy et al."" when citing it, i.e., I would point out to a student that this is technically incorrect. These are minor-ish errors in terms of the names of authors, but it brings up how ChatGPT is difficult to trust. I'm sure if one was to read the articles you had ChatGPT summarize and compare that to the the AI output that they would find, perhaps, even more important discrepancies. In addition, at the 17 min mark, we can also see that neither of the two original titles are correct at this point, but some other titles have been used. When I then look up the titles for two articles ChatGPT mentions, I don't find either cited in your original two articles nor can I find them in a broader search in Google Scholar. I agree with much of your use for brainstorming here, but there are so many red flags in terms of actual and potential factual errors in the output.","[""Dear Jaime Wright,\nI can't agree with you more.

It also involves critical thinking and decision-making based on the available evidence.\n\nTherefore, it is recommended to use AI language models like ChatGPT as a tool to assist with writing, but not as a substitute for human expertise. It is crucial to work with a human expert, such as a supervisor or research advisor, who can guide through the process of writing a systematic review or thesis, and provide feedback and corrections as needed.\n\nAdditionally, there are software tools available that can help with referencing, such as EndNote, Mendeley, or Zotero. These tools can save time and ensure accuracy in referencing, but it is still important to verify the correctness of the references manually.\n\nIn summary, while AI language models like ChatGPT can be helpful for generating text, it is essential to work with human experts and use other software tools to ensure a high-quality and accurate systematic review or thesis with referencing.']",ChatGPT - Write Essays With ChatGPT [Step By Step Tutorial],Marty Englander,2023-01-09T18:19:54Z,184121

""The Adventures of Farty the Fart""

Once upon a time, in a land filled with giggles and smiles, there lived a little fart named Farty. Farty was just like any other fart, but with a big heart. He loved to travel and explore new places, and one day he decided to go on an adventure.

Farty set off on his journey and soon discovered a world full of food. There were pizzas, burgers, and lots of beans. Farty was so excited to try all the different flavors, but he didn't know what would happen next.

As Farty ate more and more food, he started to feel very full and a little bit gassy. But Farty wasn't worried, he knew that his body was just doing what it was supposed to do. With a whoosh and a toot, Farty let out a fart.

Everyone around him started to laugh and giggle, but Farty didn't mind. He was proud of his farts and loved to see others happy. So, he continued on his journey, spreading joy and giggles wherever he went.

Farty visited farms and jungles, and even went to the moon. Everywhere he went, he let out his famous farts and made all the animals and creatures smile.

But Farty's journey was not over yet. One day, he discovered a dark and gloomy place where no one was happy. The creatures there were all sad and grumpy, and Farty knew he had to help.

So, he let out the biggest fart of all, and suddenly the place was filled with laughter and smiles. Farty had saved the day and brought happiness back to the land.

From that day on, Farty continued to travel and spread joy and laughter wherever he went. And he learned that farts may be a little bit stinky, but they can bring happiness and laughter to those around us.

Which of these can/will be ultimately be surpassed and when?\n\nIt seems inevitable that we are entering a new age characterized by unimaginable acceleration of human progress in every conceivable and unlimited as yet inconceivable fields of endeavor. \n\nThe evaluation of individual ability - perhaps this will be rendered obsolete. People will either do or will not do. Can or cannot. There may be no subjective evaluation of anything. \n\nHow many agricultural job types remain in high income nations at scale? How many are essentially supervisory jobs overseeing machines that have substituted most menial tasks. Our world now sustains an 8 billion population estimated to peak at 10 billion before declining again. In the last 100 years it has grown 4X. Meanwhile the agricultural workforce has in high income countries has declined 10X. U.S. is 1.36% of workforce despite being self-sufficient and a major food exporter. \n\nWhy would we imagine that all knowledge work as we currently understand it will decline at anything other than an exponentially greater rate. There was a massive inflection point in agriculture in wealthy countries post-WW2 in the 1950s as focus turned to automation of farming. \n\nThe computer revolution started for the same reasons at the same time. Neither have reduced unemployment in high income nations. That's where materially all the academic research takes place, especially when one considers the import of STEM talent from India, China, UK, EU  etc especially at the post-doctoral level.""]",How to summarize text using ChatGPT,Data Professor,2023-01-13T11:06:56Z,121023

They deliver these incorrect statements as if it's fact. Therefore, a bit of common sense is also extremely necessary. And well... the people working on these AI programs don't really care about that - in fact, they really don't care about anything other than their technological arms race and making absurd money from it. They pretend they don't earn any money at all to anyone poking their nose into it, selling their specialised tools to big business (tools designed to cut through the noise) while also letting kids and greedy techbros goof around with their older models for free (thus destabilising the creative arts industries, because it allows people to bypass needing any real skill to create anything).\n\nLeaving AI to mark an exam could cause similar problems - especially as the AI 'learns' from those inputs. What could be a regular mistake across all exam papers might cause the AI to change the right answer to that incorrect one, because it learns from correlation. It doesn't check to see if that correlation is correct because it's often not equipped to do so. Oh yeah, and don't tell me that anyone wanting to save money on a marking tool isn't going to use the noisy free model with all its flaws instead. Because you know they would. Favouritism sucks.
