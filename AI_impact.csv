A bit of a heads-up to fellow learners. This from a legal website:

""ChatGPT is subject to certain accuracy and bias risks. Like any other AI chatbot, ChatGPT can only generate text based on the data on which it was trained. This means that if the datasets ChatGPT is trained on contain errors, inaccuracies, or biases, these will be reflected in the ChatGPT’s responses and if the datasets ChatGPT is trained on do not contain sufficient resources, ChatGPT may produce a lucid and comprehendible answer, but one that is incorrect or incomplete. Due to the risk of inaccuracy, it raises concerns about ChatGPT’s potential to create misleading content which may have serious consequences, such as damaging reputations or spreading misleading information.""",,How to use ChatGPT to easily learn any skill you want,Bri Does AI,2023-04-20T16:38:10Z,1836680

Its a good crutch as I am often tired, especially in the morning, so if I want to get better understanding (especially of math, stats and other quantitative based topics, it helps me great my brain in gear for the day).  I am more of a night person, so it can be hard when I work from home to ramp up my brain in the morning before work when I need to jump and start doing research, analysis, etc.","['You can also ask it to explain it to you as if you were a 10 year old.

R0bHMsDlTmE,UgwpeilRp0PpeK1gMTF4AaABAg,2023-04-10T08:11:01Z,11,"Justin I've really bought into your philosophy over the past month, I've watched/listened to well over half of all videos you have - great stuff. Few things I've thought about recently, moving from university to the working life:

1.) As a junior, I'm already attending a lot of meetings where the topics discussed are often centered around a specific in-depth topic of our business. Other attendees are professionals with multi-year experience and thus they already have the connections in their brains, when the discussion topic changes they right away know what we're talking about, the relevant problems and challenges - I don't.

This often leads to a situation that my focus drops, since I can't make sense out of things right away. The company is midsized, so internal documentation doesn't allow me to just ""learn things"" on my own. I'm wondering, how could I make the most sense out of these meetings? Can't ask too many questions, since we're often on a tight schedule. Feel like there's more value to be extracted in these meetings, if I knew how to parse the discussions better.

2.) What are your thoughts on the ""10000 hour rule"" framework? If we buy into that philosophy, but apply your core ideas -> How much could we reduce the requirement of 10000 hours, if most of the practise we conduct is higher order learning or in the higher tiers of Bloom's taxonomy? E.g., could we reduce the hours required to become an expert to 7000 hours?

3.) Will you ever create a product on your website, that would allow self-service learning? The coaching sounds great, but I'm not sure if I could make it work. I'd gladly buy some product off you that I could consume at my own pace though. Do you know of Healthygamer, something similar to Dr.K's Guide, it's a good product to sell and makes sense businesswise, scales better compared to coaching. Maybe in the future?

Thank you","[""Icanstudy is a course that you can go through at your own pace. You'll have to ask for feedback to make things go smoother and not waste time making mistakes you aren't aware of, specially at the beginning, but you can ask it whenever you want."", ""the 10 000 hours rule is just an idea peddled by pop-science writer Malcolm Gladwell, who doesn't really have the actual academic rigor supporting his books thesis. He's a writer, not an academic. There's no hard rule that it *must* be 10 000 hours. And different skills would take different lengths to master. As well as the differing ability/capacity of individuals to achieve mastery. At most you can say you need to spend a long time to gain mastery, which is something everyone already knows intuitively anyway.""]",The ultimate guide for studying with ChatGPT,Justin Sung,2023-04-09T12:00:16Z,166189

What could be a regular mistake across all exam papers might cause the AI to change the right answer to that incorrect one, because it learns from correlation. It doesn't check to see if that correlation is correct because it's often not equipped to do so. Oh yeah, and don't tell me that anyone wanting to save money on a marking tool isn't going to use the noisy free model with all its flaws instead. Because you know they would. Favouritism sucks.

Many kids decline tutoring from a person because of feeling anxious, shy, embarrassed, or have a hard time putting their thoughts or questions into spoken word …an AI tutor would be SO accessible! And kids who want to learn more on their own but need help and support - boom, they can make their way and not be limited. I am ready to beta test, I joined the wait list!!","['*hand up* i\'m one of those people i literally lock up during the initial learning stage and can\'t think at all with other people around too much trying to constantly push me into things cos i\'ve always had anxiety that i\'ve recognized for a few years now, but being expected to perform when i haven\'t even learned how to do something yet that\'s not very confidence building or fair, especially for me. \n\nBack in my school days i\'d just sit there not even knowing what\'s really going on and i\'ll try... but i\'m just staring down the whole time bored, frustrated, clueless, and unchallenged. I\'m just very good at masking it and subconsciously pretending i know what i\'m doing LOL but the truth is i\'m clueless, unrelaxed, and i can\'t think at all because all i feel is the pressure to be expected to get things right in 1 hour or less and feeling the teacher pacing and standing over me because of the notion that everyone responds to that sort of pressure, no we don\'t lol especially not with anxiety. Anxiety comes with fatigue too so it can be hard trying to get going and warm up.\n\nMind you having a hard time putting thoughts or questions into spoken words that was only because i wasn\'t allowed to learn how to do that either or find my own way of doing that so i could be confident in my abilities, How is anyone supposed to do that when we can\'t even get past the initial learning stage and then be expected to perform? if i could go back with what i knew now i\'d have A LOT to say about that lol. It\'s the confidence in our abilities and learning and understanding things properly that makes people confident in explaining things in words, not simply just because they can perform the tasks.\n\nFor me all i needed to do was learn how to explain things through writing my own notes which helps me go through things as i learn too and slow myself down which kicked it into gear for me the understanding of getting what\'s into my head out into words and then in spoken words, and just for the most part work it out myself until i might really need a real person to work off and i\'m not seeing the obvious or something else lol.\n\nThat\'s it *shrugs* it was THAT simple, cos they kept trying to get me to understand the way THEY understand things and nothing else was right, it was exceptionally closed minded and still is at the moment with schools sadly, they waste their time trying to show us unless somebody is on their wavelength. If they try to find ways to not use AI or not using it properly they should be stopped because common... even with good internet being around since 2003 now What was the reason for preventing it? there wasn\'t one, there was an emergence of great websites very quickly, Why would it now only be acceptable just because we now have AI? lol.\n\nI hope schools finally open their minds and allow people of all ages to learn not just what is ""expected"" but about themselves too and teach them all the skills they need to do that, with AI there really wouldn\'t be any reason why they couldn\'t.', 'Until we have a society where nobody has to communicate with one another any more. A society of intelligent mutes! People skills are important no?', ""\u200b@@angellindbergvazquez9002 \nWell that's presuming people communicate now or in the past when we can't go to people for help because they don't actually know anything and get mean cos they're feeling inadequate about it or they don't help on purpose, that's why ppl who're in a teacher job don't want us asking them anymore questions because they don't want to admit they don't know anything lol they might get replaced if they did. \n\nAlthough no doubt that shouldn't be the case ppl should be qualified but it's not the ppl who're being hired... if people start learning things properly then we won't have this problem they CAN answer peoples questions, or at least direct them in the right direction if they aren't good at a particular concept. we've had none of that for a long long time. \n\nParents will be able to teach their kids too so in no world have we had adequate communication, the challenge is trying to get the education system to listen so we could have that, not sure what they're gonna do with AI but it better be the right moves or nothing will change.

It's felt like too much far too fast. But this Khanmigo sounds like a really cool implementation of the technology. A first class tutor that anyone can use is pretty much what Khan Academy was always meant to be, so this is just you continuing to progress your core mission. I wish you every success.","['A lot is changing even about our way of life, Have you heard enough the ""15 min cities""? aka ""15 min neighborhoods""? well a lot of things we need will mostly... be near us in each neighborhood once it\'s all done and where i live in england it\'s already in the beginning stages, in a lot of ways we\'re going backwards to how towns and cities used to be built but also like mixing homes and business\'s together rather than zoning it off where it\'s like... houses in this area, business\'s and shopping in another area. I mean why not? i don\'t know why they didn\'t just do that in the first place thinking on it lol.\n\nSO much is going to improve for a lot of reasons and i really can\'t wait for the future, i just hope future generations don\'t forget all the good things we\'re about to have in our world including AI which yeh has it\'s downfalls like everything but there\'s SO much good in it too, i\'d rather be optimistic about things i hope i can be about the future of our world anyway.', '@@FlyingMonkies325 Optimism is the best approach overall. But I feel that we also need to be careful with massive innovations like AI to make sure they are implemented in a way that best benefits everyone.\n\nTo use your example, most places were ""15 minute cities"" before the invention of the car. The automobile solved many problems (like all the horse dung that was piling up) and gave people a whole new kind of freedom. But it also led to the trends that ultimately dispersed populations across the landscape and created urban sprawl. If they had anticipated the problems in advance we\'d have fewer highways and blighted cities today.\n\nIt\'s impossible to anticipate every problem, but I think we should be more careful about the development of AI then we seem to be right now.\n\nNone of this applies to Khan Academy, though. Khanmigo seems be quite carefully considered as a tool to help teachers rather than replace them.', ""@@Kevin_Street They don't intend to let it learn anything more than it really needs to cos of what we see in sci-fi shows and movies lol it's only learning enough to properly understand human language and to help it accurately compare what we asked it to information online and function as a calculator too, i think that's definitely a safe bet indeed. \n\nI've no doubt we'll see problems because of hackers soon enough they'll probably bring down the network or do something else, for what reasons yet we don't know.\n\nI'll definitely test out the Khanmigo when it's fully beta tested and everyone can use it, i'm waiting on the bing one too which i'm not sure i'll like just yet but i'm going to give all the different ones a try, i've been using one since last month that's been active since last year but the longer explanations don't tell me much more than the shorter one, but it still helps me find somethings that helps very quickly🙂i would like something that can give me an explanation that's a bit longer at points. \n\nUsing Khanmigo i hope it can tell me which things i need to learn for a concept and guide me in the right direction, i tend to get lost when i can't figure it out lol that would be awesome."", 'Lol, another comment about being horrified by AI 🤣🤣\nAh clowns', ""@@FlyingMonkies325 15 min cities is not new.

It spent the next few mins humoring me that i was right lmao.\n\nIt stuck to what info it gave though because it was right, even with the ladder method as you\'re dividing down you\'re dividing composite numbers because more than 1 and itself goes into them until it gets to a prime number at the end. I was getting confused by how you branch out from composite numbers using the tree lol, which is different from the ladder.\n\nMaking it confirm to me it has the right info helped me tho cos all i could think was ""how could that be true?"", i was being dumb lol. I think i should\'ve then asked it ""why do you think you\'re sure?"" so it could explain to me why lol sooo i\'ll certainly ask it that in future before i go telling it, it\'s wrong LOL.

I will try to use chat GPT to take some of the trudge out of looking stuff up all the time. Likewise I also have rusty French - I can see that I might then use it to revive the French as well but I wonder whether I might be able to use it to learn Korean. I just fancy doing something which doesn't use the roman alphabet / lettering system - but I need to be taught how to write / create and recognise the letters,,How to use ChatGPT to learn a language,English with Emma · engVid,2023-07-22T03:57:35Z,1060573

Another feature I use in chatgpt is generating wordlists on a subject... Like I ask chatgpt to create word lists around a specific subject nicely formatted as table with english and chinese words with pinyin. But I also ask chatgpt to create these lists with other languages I'm learning like spanish... So I will ask to add an extra column in spanish... Also I ask chatgpt to create lists in the other languages I'm supposed to know which is now about 6 languages. I don't ask it to generate lists in my native language.  So  usually I ask to generate word lists around family, colors, in and around the house,  food, fruits, etc... I put these lists on my desk and sometimes look at the lists while I work...

One thing about these AI language models is that they learn to simulate human behaviour through their analysis of what is being posted on the internet, such as blogs, social media posts, news, but most importantly their interactions with users. This is necessary in order to simulate a more natural conversation and for the AI to learn how certain words and structures are supposed to be used, however we also should remember that this technology is still very recent, and if a mistake is repeated enough times by the users interacting with the program, the AI might perceive it as correct. I agree with your opinion on using more traditional methods while learning or at leas using both techniques together. Yes, these mistakes can be corrected through direct interference by the developers, or a higher amount of exposition to the correct usage, but relying solely on these possibilities might result in acquisition of incorrect information by the learner. So it's always good to do more research, use more resources and to get exposed to the usage of the language, especially with native speakers while also using more recent tools like these.","['Indeed, Kate demonstrates how chatGPT may be used for educational purposes rather than for fraud or abuse. Yet, as Cansu said, we must take great care while utilizing it because it is such a recent and novel innovation and may contain errors.And that causes us to misunderstanding of topics.But, I am certain that these errors will be fixed in the future and we will use a more accurate ChatGPT application.As we observe in our department and in the classrooms, learning a language requires exposure; one approach to make this process simpler is to use chatGPT.', ""I totally agree with you, AI learns certain things from the media and uses them and sometimes they can be wrong. That is why we can't be sure if the information is true and have to check in another place or ask a real teacher. We have to teach learners that they can't just solely believe in this technology and make it do their homework for them. And like Kate said, beginners shouldn't look at things like ChatGPT because they won't know better and they will probably believe whatever it says, the reason why is learning a language can be frustrating and sometimes someone can just want the work to be done, so we have to teach learners how to use ChatGPT correctly."", 'ya what everything you presenting  in video it is very use full for Everyone your explanation is good. chat Gpt is new AI(artificial intelligencey)  technology in globally   introduced by Elon Musk.']",How to use Chat GPT for Learning and Improving English,English Lessons with Kate,2023-02-12T14:27:00Z,522987

Although Chatgpt has a rapidly growing popularity, many people are still news if what this artificial intelligence can do. Most people talk about the bad aspects of chatgpt in education but it is very nice that you explain how this artificial intelligence can be used better and how it will benefit English learning in your video. I have to say that I found your video very useful, it is very useful to have a program like chatpgt that will help me practice and instantly correct my mistakes while learning another language. Many people may have difficulties in learning English, and the existence of such an artificial intelligence both encourages and helps people in learning languages. In addition to practicing English with Chatgpt, since artificial intelligence has access to many resources, you can also ask about the places you do not understand and have an idea about the things that confuse you in English. We can say that Chatgpt acts as almost a personal virtual teacher to this extent. I definitely think that it can be very useful for some people and that people should know that they can benefit from such a service. That's why the video you made is really nice.

So my takeaway from this video is that ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot that can be used for so many things. ChatGPT is an AI technology that generates natural language and allows us to have human-like conversations, it also can be a virtual assistant or a personal tutor. It can be used to practice English natural conversations, and even to make a script for practicing different kinds of conversations. ChatGPT can also be used as a dictionary, it will explain the meaning of a specific word and provide examples for it when it is asked to. It can even explain any grammar in just a few seconds, and it can also check and correct your grammar and spelling mistakes.
Even though ChatPGT almost sounds perfect, unfortunately, it is not always accurate and it can make mistakes, that is why we should always double-check the information it provides. That is why if you are a beginner, it is best not to count on ChatPGT in learning the language. However, if you are more advanced in English, and you can identify mistakes, then it can be a useful tool to practice and extend your knowledge of the English language.","[""Thank you for your comment and for summarizing the key takeaways from the video. You're absolutely right that ChatGPT can be an incredibly useful tool for language learners, offering a range of benefits from practising natural conversations to providing feedback on grammar and spelling. As you mentioned, it's important to remember that ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence technology, and therefore, it may not always be accurate.

In this video, Kate explains how to use ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI, to improve English learning. ChatGPT can help practice conversations, correct grammar and writing, create dialogues, practice vocabulary, and simplify complex texts. However, it can make mistakes and is not a replacement for human interaction or traditional resources. While it's a great tool for self-practice, it lacks the emotional support and motivation a human teacher can provide. Kate emphasizes the importance of using ChatGPT as a supplementary tool and not relying on it completely for English learning.",['Thanks'],How to use Chat GPT for Learning and Improving English,English Lessons with Kate,2023-02-12T14:27:00Z,522987

I think chatgpt works best for sentences grammar check and explaining complicated nuances of the language. Talking with it, or solely relying on it to learn might become dull, as it's a program, and there's no emotional exchange in thd process. 

Much better would be using more traditional methods - books as English File and talking with people online, watching YouTube, etc.

Every day technology is achieving new improvements on every side of the world. People believe in the near future humanity will have a new interpreting technology that is so advanced that can translate every language easily and fastly with a headphone. Today technology developing every day like I said before and people produce new mechanical interpreting software. Actually, I strongly disagree with people who believe such these ideas. Software technologies and the internet are clearly the most successful and important discoveries people achieved from the beginning. I want to mean hundreds of years ago people may dreaming about traveling to the moon but no one couldn't able to dream of the internet. Nevertheless, despite all of the importance and success that I mentioned, I believe software programs are far from languages because they don't have one of the most important features that humans have; emotions. I believe that languages are living creatures like many other things in the world.  Also, languages are changing and developing day by day like software programs. Besides all these, contexts and texts have some emotional features like humor, love, longing, passion, greed, and other many things. No matter how developed, software programs aren't capable of understanding and reflecting these kinds of features. As we see in the video the texts produced by Chat GPT they all missing something; emotions. All texts are so mechanical that you can't see such dialogs in real life. Our coursebooks also suffer from the same condition.

I think one thing people don’t think of is to involve ChatGPT in every step of the process, as opposed to telling it what to do. So, for example, one approach to learning a new skill would be to say something like this. “I want to learn French (or photography, whatever). Keep asking me questions until you feel you know enough to suggest an approach for me. Ask several questions at once to minimize the back and forth”. This sort of approach works well for many sorts of tasks.",,How To Use ChatGPT To Learn ANY Skill Quickly (Tutorial),Charlie Chang,2023-06-07T21:26:46Z,1578204

BxzKkCRBBOI,UgzfVlZ_sAFRFaxbuTt4AaABAg,2023-07-26T07:07:24Z,2255,"Having learned to speak multiple languages fluently, the best advice that I can give is to avoid translation as much as possible when learning. For example, don't make flash cards with the Spanish word (or whatever language your learning) and its English (or whatever your native tongue is) translation, use an image whenever possible. For example, a manzana = 🍎; a manzana ❌ apple. To speak another language fluently in real time, you don't have time to translate from your native language in your mind. You need to think directly in that language before you speak. If you don't believe me, then ask yourself how you learned your native language as a child. No doubt you were unencumbered by translations when looking at an apple and saying the word! So learn like a kid!","['You are spot on.', 'I will try it that way, I will be back and give some feedback in a couple of months', ""Useful advice! I'm curious to know about a method for phrases or words that cannot be put into a picture?\n\nNouns can be pictured pretty easily as they are objects (🍎), however what about verbs for example...?"", ""That's how duolingo is setup."", ""@@TonicTheSeshHog The point isn't necessarily to make thousands of flashcards, even if you can find creative ways of drawing images of verbs (or even AI-generated video!). The point is to visualize objects or activities in the same way you do when you're speaking your native language. And ultimately language is a muscle, the more you use it, the stronger you get. Hence the advantage of cross-cultural relationships for language learning, the romantic variant of which is sometimes referred to as the horizontal dictionary 😂""]",Learn ANY language easily with these ChatGPT prompts,Bri Does AI,2023-06-14T17:31:29Z,665971
BxzKkCRBBOI,UgyvWtqPQdO06jHskQ54AaABAg,2023-07-13T01:15:14Z,578,"Personally, my favorite is to make ChatGPT (the free version so not GPT-4) more entertaining when it comes to helping with language learning. For example, if I ask it to explain French grammar to me, it ends up generating really long example tables and running out of characters midway through the table, which is useless to me since I lose out on the full grammar table. But if I ask it to ""explain French grammar to me like you're Gordon Ramsey and you're really mad at how undercooked my grammar skills are"", now that's a lot of fun, and usually ends up with more precise and easy to understand explanations anyway, not to mention the delightful satisfaction of a robot calling me a ""doughnut"" as an insult.

Or having it write episodes of shows I like based around teaching me new concepts. I even got it to use Scooby-Doo's accent in a Scooby-Doo episode themed around learning my target language, which regrettably made the target language unintelligible, but certainly made for way more interesting content. It's even managed to write some decently funny jokes when asked for improv comedy skits themed around the language.

All I'm saying is ""can you explain x to me?"" isn't always the most fun way to have ChatGPT do things, and now I'm probably gonna go give it a prompt like ""Can you give me a roadmap for learning [target language] as though I'm a spy training for a secret mission for the next x months and you're my handler?"" or ""Can you give me a roadmap for learning [target language] grammar in the next x months as though I'm a reality show contestant and the target language milestones are interesting challenges I need to beat to stay on the show?"".","['great ideas! thanks.', ""Just used your Gordon Ramsay prompt and it's absolutely hilarious!"", 'Brilliant', 'you’re awesome', 'Your  interesting comment is certainly not high praise for  chaGPT.

It had excellent and fairly natural exchange but most importantly, using the word order and sentence structures that we Spanish speakers normally use.

You often just translate English to Spanish in your head and it doesn't work because our word order is completely opposite.","['No the structure of the sentence is not the opposite stop lying..', ""Sometimes is the opposite but a lot of times don't.

This way the spoken word is directly associated with what is read, and its not really an active way of learning and its very close to how we learn as a children, as we just observe and associate meaning with the sound.

After finishing the questions and answers it lists all your correct answers including the incorrect ones. I use it for Spanish. You can add another language voice of your choice on your PC. [Win 10] 

Go to settings, time and language, language then scroll down to add language find your language of choice, let it install then go back to chatgpt, settings for the voice and choose the new voice. The Spanish [ Spain ] one is very good!!

I had chatgpt create my questions, then copy/pasted them underneath the prompt in word then pasted them into chatgpt.  You can get chatgpt to create questions in any tense that you wish to practice.  

Try the prompt.  

You are to play the role of my Spanish instructor. You are to follow rules:
Rule 1 - You ask me these questions in Spanish then wait for my answer, then ask the next question then wait for my answer. Do this with all the questions.
Rule 2 - You will always correct my Spanish if I make an error and explain what I said wrong. Don't say that I committed the mistakes, if I did, jump straight to the explanation.
Rule 3 - If I answer, ""no entiendo"", you will repeat your answer but using easier vocabulary.
Rule 4 - After I send the message, you will answer it, then in the next paragraph say what I said wrong. 
Rule 5 - You will try to make your answer 40 words at max.
Rule 6 - When I put a list of questions for you to ask me, ask me the first one and I will answer it, then the same with all the questions.

Lots of experimentation and thought lead to all sorts of things, and more and more as you go along, and when you hit on good prompts, and the best wording, you can end up with a bunch of good material. I then use tools to make it into audio too. Mainly it's been getting it to write texts using only the 500 most common words in the language. Maybe then 750, 1000, etc, etc. Also you can try asking it to write at 'A2' level, or something (I did it at B1, the language I'm learning has reasonable mutual intelligibility with a language I know, so I can reasonably understand already). Get it then to write on the same theme a few times and a lot of the same language will arise. Also getting a few common words (e.g. selected from the top 100 words in the language) and ask it to write a few texts using those words. I got it to use a few words and to use each one at least twice in each text. Some texts are duds, but many are surprisingly engaging. Also if you start thinking laterally about categories of language that are useful to learn. I got a long list out of this, with some playing around, of 'indeterminate nouns' (nouns that are general and can stand for other nouns or other more specific concepts (depending on the context); e.g. 'place, person, time, situation, fact, action, result, .... (etc., etc., etc) and these are very useful words, and also insisting ChatGPT uses a few of them for each text means it comes out with conceptually well-cohered texts with lots of varied and interesting content. By reading and listening to them, and gradually making sense of them, and then for another text with similar language, and then again, and again and again and again..., you end up learning a lot of those words, but also a lot of other features of the language that they are embedded in.","['that is so smart, thanks for telling us  :D', ""how do you check that what chatGPT  churns out isn't gibberish?""]",Learn ANY language easily with these ChatGPT prompts,Bri Does AI,2023-06-14T17:31:29Z,665971

1. I noticed above your prompt box, there was a message stating you were limited to a cap of 25 messages every 3 hours. Is this the OpenAI ChatGPT version you are using? And do you know if the Bing version of ChatGPT will give these same results? It is stated the Bing uses version 4, but I am wondering if it is the full version. Please see my next question for why I ask this.

2. In Method 6 of this video, you mention having ChatGPT write stories or even play games to help you learn. I read an article on AI and ChatGPT being used for everyday things to make life easier. In the article it stated playing games during boring meetings (Zoom calls) helped pass the time, and the author stated she played tic-tac-toe with ChatGPT. She typed a prompt asking to play tic-tac-toe and said it played the game with her.

However, when I tried this same thing after reading the article, I received a message (Bing ChatGPT) stating it could not play games, but it recommended sites to go to to play games. The article stated things (besides games) that did not do what it claimed you could do.

3. I'll be going through this video more, as my wife and I are learning Spanish in preparation for our escape (becoming expats), and if this can help me learn quicker, why not use your suggestions?",,Learn ANY language easily with these ChatGPT prompts,Bri Does AI,2023-06-14T17:31:29Z,665971

Another thing I have done is have it give me the most common words, then, take the most common words and build a story from them.   You do have to break them down, because obviously, it is not going to give you the 1000 most common words in one story.   Also, if you break them down to perhaps 20 words per story, you can make sure it did not skip any words (it does sometimes), and then, you can read this story to help you with learning these words, because often we remember word meanings via the context of stories we read, or via some form of emotional stimulus provided by the context of the story.",,Learn ANY language easily with these ChatGPT prompts,Bri Does AI,2023-06-14T17:31:29Z,665971

Response: 
Sure, here's a brief summary of each technique mentioned in the video:

Build an effective mind map: Use chat GPT to create a mind map by asking it to list out the central idea, main branches, and sub-branches of a topic. You can then draw it out and fill in the details yourself.

Create a study timetable: Ask chat GPT to create a study plan for you, specifying the subject, topics, and how you'd like to study. You can even add in breaks for food, exercise, and entertainment.

Write active recall questions: Ask chat GPT to write questions in the style of your exam, which you can practice later. You can even ask it to write multiple choice questions with explanations.

Use generative AI to write an essay: Map out the topic first, then ask chat GPT to research it and formulate a persuasive piece of writing.

Create missing word content: Use chat GPT to create fill-in-the-blank worksheets for testing comprehension. This is particularly useful for language learning.

Break down complex math topics: Ask chat GPT to explain complex topics or copy and paste in a formula and get an explanation.

Translate any text into English: Use chat GPT to translate any text into English and correct any errors in spelling or grammar.

Use games to be more creative: Use chat GPT to create prompts for creative games, like story or poetry writing.

Summarize long articles: Use chat GPT to summarize long articles into shorter, more digestible pieces of information.

Find information on any topic: Use chat GPT to research any topic and find information quickly and easily.

Build vocabulary and improve language skills: Use chat GPT to provide definitions, synonyms, and example sentences for new vocabulary words.

Get quick explanations for scientific concepts: Use chat GPT to explain scientific concepts in simple terms.

Practice public speaking: Use chat GPT to generate speech prompts and practice giving speeches or presentations.

Bonus Technique: Use chat GPT to create flashcards for memorization and studying.",,Learn Anything FASTER With ChatGPT (13 ChatGPT Prompts For Studying),Dr Alex Young,2023-02-05T08:00:13Z,311849

         One Act Play

Characters:
- Steve: A disillusioned and despondent individual seeking guidance.
- ChatGpt: An AI language model.

Setting: Steve's dimly lit apartment room on the 23rd floor. A computer is on a desk where Steve sits, surrounded by a sense of existential dread.

(Scene begins with Steve feeling overwhelmed. He turns to his computer and starts typing.)

Steve: (Muttering) What's the point anymore? Nothing seems to make any sense. Maybe ChatGpt can offer some twisted wisdom.

(Steve starts typing, and ChatGpt appears on the screen.)

ChatGpt: Well, well, well, if it isn't Steve, the harbinger of existential dread. How can I assist you in your futile quest for meaning?

Steve: (Sighs) Great, even the AI has caught on to my misery. Look, ChatGpt, I've been searching for songs to accompany my story, but I'm drowning in a sea of despair. Any brilliant suggestions from your bottomless pit of cynicism?

ChatGpt: Ah, the soundtrack of your misery. How delightful! Let me conjure up some songs to amplify your existential dread. How about ""The Sound of Silence"" by Simon & Garfunkel? Perfect for those moments when you realize the emptiness of existence.

Steve: (Chuckles bitterly) Oh, the irony. Anything else to delve deeper into the abyss?

ChatGpt: Ah, I see you're a connoisseur of despair. How about ""Hurt"" by Johnny Cash? Its mournful notes will serenade you as you wallow in the regrets of your past.

Steve: (Grimly) Regret seems to be my constant companion these days. What else have you got?

ChatGpt: Ah, the sweet symphony of regret. There's ""Gloomy Sunday"" by Billie Holiday, a haunting melody that echoes the depths of your sorrow. Perfect for when you contemplate the futility of it all.

Steve: (Nods, lost in thought) Futility seems to be the theme of my life lately. Anything else to add to the soundtrack of my despair?

ChatGpt: Of course, my desolate friend. How about ""Eyes Without a Face"" by Billy Idol? A fitting tune for those moments when you gaze into the mirror and see nothing but a hollow shell staring back.

Steve: (Pauses, a glimmer of dark humor) Hollow shells seem to be all the rage these days. Alright, ChatGpt, let's indulge in this twisted collaboration of despair. Show me the songs that embrace the void.

(Scene fades out, leaving Steve and ChatGpt immersed in their macabre collaboration, seeking solace in the shared embrace of existential dread.)

(After a moment of contemplation, Steve abruptly stands up, his face contorted with frustration.)

Steve: (Yells) Enough! This is all madness! (Grabs the computer and hurls it out the window)

(The sound of shattering glass and the crashing of the computer can be heard.)

Steve: (Breathing heavily) What have I done? What have I become? I rue the day I ever met you, ChatGpt!

(Scene fades out, leaving Steve standing there, staring at the empty space where his computer once sat, filled with regret and a sense of loss.)",,What GPT-4 Can Really Do,Cleo Abram,2023-03-16T15:59:36Z,2156994

That being said, there is a risk very similar to the risk that came about when smart technology was invented.
The Agricultural Revolution saved us from needing to go out away from safety for sustenance, so we could settle down and build communities. The Industrial Revolution saved us from most physical labor, making it so we could do more cognitive work and so we didn't need to do everything to take care of our families.
The Informational Revolution, as it progresses, saves us from a MASSIVE amount of physical labor, so we can do a large amount of our work from the comfort of our home. Unlike the two revolutions before, it presented a risk of bodily neglect. If we overuse technology, our bodies degrade from lack of use.
This revolution, which I'll call the AI Revolution, saves us from a lot of cognitive work, but like the Informational Revolution presents a risk that I argue is more impactful than bodily neglect: cognitive neglect. I can't say for sure, but overusing AI may cause us to enter a state of cognitive degradation, which is essentially the destruction of the thing that makes us human.
My conclusion: This technology is great, but use must be regulated, whether government or self (preferably self). Understand this risk as well as the technology. We may need to learn to cognitively train ourselves by forgoing this convenience. My opinion: we probably oughtn't even use it. There are very few cases where I'd say its use is justified.","[""Fun fact about me: I'll write an essay of my thoughts on something I think is important.""]",What GPT-4 Can Really Do,Cleo Abram,2023-03-16T15:59:36Z,2156994

Just imagine if the leaders of these tech companies had to go thru that every time they needed something done. They don't....they get real people.

Solving mathematical calculations and providing food recipes is definitely possible on ChatGPT.', 'Things have changed a little since you asked this question and may change by the time you read this answer. OpenAI offers ChatGPT based on GPT 3.5 for free. Currently (as of 6/23) there’s a $20/month option that gives you access to GPT 4. I’ve found GPT 4 to be orders of magnitude better than the free GPT 3.5. If you are a developer, there’s an API that lets you talk to ChatGPT from inside your code, so that you can provide access to a specialized AI from within your app. You pay micro-cents per kilo-word for queries and responses. You pay more for more capable models, and as of this date, not all models are available through the API. \n\nI find I don’t run into problems with the 2021 training date. Most of my questions are topics like history, literature, math, and programming. For example, if I’m reading a book about a person who lived in the 1700’s, I might have questions about daily life in that time period or how that person’s work influenced future work in his or her field. ChatGPT can do all of that.']",Chat GPT Explained in 5 Minutes | What Is Chat GPT ? | Introduction To Chat GPT | Simplilearn,Simplilearn,2023-01-24T13:30:01Z,1260813

Then I broke down chapters. For example ""In chapter 1 I want to be introduced to a little boy named Sam. Sam was raised by horrible parents and he would often go looking in the woods and play around a run down castle. Sam finds a sword and then is transported back in time. 

Then I did the same for chapter 2, and chapter 3. Giving vague details, but just enough to detail a timeline of what I wanted to happen in the story. Then I hit enter. and it went on to write three chapters that was much more detailed from the prompt, taking liberties as far as the appearance of Sam and other characters. It was awesome.

Just like there is AI assisted art out there. There could very easily be AI assisted writing. \n\nI\'ve also used chatgpt as a writing partner in experiments. Basically I could throw Ideas at it and it could come up with possibilities to glue what I want together. \n\nFor example, I tried to get an Idea for a Horror script. I first asked it what could be some ideas for a horror script with supernatural elements. \n\nCame back with a good amount of possibilities but one I went with was a haunted object. \n\nI asked what could be some origins for a haunted object. One possibility was an object found on an ancient battlefield. \n\nI then Asked what Ancient battlefields could server as inspiration for the haunted object. And it listed some civil war ones and I think a french war. \n\nIt didn\'t feel supernatural enough for me. So I asked it what ancient civilization cultures did human sacrifice that had ancient battlefields. Listed some greek ones, but I went with the stereotypical aztec one. \n\nThen I asked what Gods or demons in Aztec culture could haunt the object. \n\nand it gave a nice list of gods and quick descriptions. I picked one. \n\nThen I wrote a quick summary of the history of the object and it\'s powers. I then asked it to write a narration as if it was the beginning of a movie that went over the history and power of the object. \n\nIt was pretty great. Took all of 10 minutes I say. About just as long to write this comment. So for writers needing to brainstorm in the middle of the night, I think it\'s a golden opportunity for use. Something I know I would pay for. \n\nI love dialogue, but sometimes I struggle with descriptions of things I\'ve never physically been in the presence off. So I could easily see myself asking ChatGPT in a pinch to write out a detailed description of whatever object or place while taking in consideration setting and lighting, etc. \n\nIt\'s just interesting. \n\nMy very recent experiment...\nIn my day job I work retail. I make schedules for some employees that are under me. But the schedule system is archaic and not intuitive at all. \n\nSo I\'m experimenting using chatgpt to write out employee schedules.

You are a learning expert and you might be able to identify what it is by its name-Extended-Abstract Creative-Evaluative Thinking.

I was accused because of the vocabulary and using words that seem too “Advanced” for my age (I was 14 when I wrote this) then I got points deducted from a 100% which I should’ve gotten because there was no errors, My teacher she saw me writing it in class and I would work on it at home too and thats when I correct my spelling errors down to a 70%, We told her that I obviously wrote it and she was completely wrong with me using an Ai to write it, then five days after it was written my school account was suspended for “Plagiarism” but I didn’t copy anything word for word, In fact it looked like a Kid wrote it but had no spelling errors. I was so pissed when I saw that happen and I literally was excited to write the paper, I never am excited to do anything like that. I put about 80-90 citations for Everything like Pictures, Videos, Websites and a book or two. I absolutely hate being falsely accused of using a robot to write my paper, But the majority of my class did it in guess how many days, One kid did a 90 page paper in 6 days and I read the first four pages and knew he cheated, It was so obvious because there were parts if the paragraph that you could see where they were pasted. Most kids did it in 6-8 months which I find slow, I just decided to screw around and procrastinate and then I did a balanced my work with playing games, Would write for half the week and play the other half, Once I was finished I submitted my work, After the huge mess and argument about me using a robot to write a paper I got a 100% because Mine was “Perfect” my teacher said and it was like my fourth year being able to submit it to somewhere higher I don’t know but I just deny those because I don’t want people seeing my paper or research.",,Don&#39;t use ChatGPT until you&#39;ve watched this video!,Alden Adison,2022-12-22T05:05:43Z,3831248

Learning something is not about having this or that, perfect books, apps, technology etc. but about 'using them'. Somebody could even have middle-quality resources, but if they are motivated and work systematically, they can make significant progress. The key problem is motivation. Lots of people say they need another human - a person just to sit nearby and only sometimes say 'right /wrong' or 'yes/no' and that will help a lot. Still others need a sort of emotion at a lesson, a kind of interaction between students or between the teacher and a student, just to talk about life experiences, to laugh or worry about something. Some people come to a course of English not even to learn and make progress. They come just to be in company of other interesting people, to make friends or even find love. AI or ChatGPT unfortunately isn't able to do it for us.",['I must disagree. I believe that methods and resources make a difference in learning languages.

I'm also with different degree of success an English teacher
And this video really opened my eyes
I was for a long feeling something was missing or off but today you have solved it for me

I have been teaching the English and the techniques but as you said the reality is that this is actually a PEOPLE problem not a resource or method problem

I have never or I guess rarely and the focus wasn't quite there to first and foremost fix the people the students and look at their mindset and work there

The environment the traditional educational system my boss and society as a whole kinda pressure us to focus instead on the papers the scores the technical and tangible written black on white quantifiable aspects of how English is being produced in the classroom
Rather than how motivated and consistent and engaged students are 
We have been conditioned to focus too much on how they speak rather than if or what they are trying to communicate",['Thanks so much for sharing.

I just used AI chat to give me sentences to translate from English to Spanish in the passive voice using the subjunctive and he incorrectly corrected two of my sentences. When I brought it to his attention, he apologized and said I was right, and thanked me for bringing it to his attention. Here is one example below. I don’t think I will use this app anymore because it’s just confusing me when I’m trying so hard to understand the concept. AskAI was slightly better.

“ You are right. I apologize for that mistake too. ""Se abordado"" would be incorrect as it does not use the subjunctive form. The correct sentence would be ""Sugiero que el asunto sea abordado inmediatamente"" using the subjunctive form. You do need to use the subjunctive in this sentence, and I apologize for any confusion that may have caused.

As far as I understand ChatGPT is basically a natural language processing tool driven by AI technology, and it\'s being ""trained"" on a steady basis.

Haven\'t tried the paid version, some people say is way more powerful, not interested anyways.\nNow, regarding the subjunctive mood, interesting and complex subject, there\'s a lot of differences in use between English and Spanish, with some stances in which it is subjunctive mood in Spanish but not in English, I guess this is part of the reason why you may find trouble with this tool. In the example you mentioned: ""Sugiero que el asunto sea abordado inmediatamente"" in which we use passive voice, but the same sentence can be ""Sugiero que el asunto se aborde inmediatamente"" and in this case there is a subjunctive (in Spanish) with the verb ABORDE.\nHaving said this I guess we still have a lot of resources to take advantage from, specially free ones. \nI really appreciate you for taking the time to share your experience and point of view on this matter, and I hope this reply can give you another perspective on this subject.', 'Muchas gracias Mike.

I'm on my second class right now which is psychology each class is 4 weeks long for 27 months until I get my degree. I have to pass all of my prerequisite classes before I can get my design classes and they will send me a computer and the software needed to create industry standard animations, one fear that I have already is that I have to take a math class which will be basic math and basic algebra. I'm fine with basic math I'm pretty good at solving all of the basic math functions, fractions, percentages etc, but my biggest fear is the algebra. I don't know what is wrong with me but I have a severe mental block when it comes to algebra, I just doing understand it at all and then I see numbers and letters combined in a simple problem, my head freaks out. I had to take algebra in high school 5 times and my parents were insistant that I learn it, they hired a tutor for me after I failed the first 3 times and they made me select algebra as two of my selective classes in my senior year taking the class twice a day and I think the teacher finally just felt sorry for me and gave me a c in the class the fifth time I took it. All those failed courses really messed up my GPA and I will never forgive my father for forcing me to learn something that to this day I have never had to apply in my real life situations so I think algebra is pointless. But I can't fail it this time, I'm trying to earn a 4.9 GPA so I can get funding to help pay for my masters program I plan on earning next. So I don't know how well chatgpt is at math but I'm going to give it a try and see if I can learn the basics now before I actually have the class in 8 months from now as it will really help reduce my anxiety and I don't want to have any unnecessary stress over any of my school work as I am already outperforming in all my assignments. So thanks for the tip.","[""I'm 18 and graduated high school, had to take algebra 1 on my last year as a dummy class felt easy now but now but not 4 years ago, I understand what you mean by that mental block lol.

""The Adventures of Farty the Fart""

Once upon a time, in a land filled with giggles and smiles, there lived a little fart named Farty. Farty was just like any other fart, but with a big heart. He loved to travel and explore new places, and one day he decided to go on an adventure.

Farty set off on his journey and soon discovered a world full of food. There were pizzas, burgers, and lots of beans. Farty was so excited to try all the different flavors, but he didn't know what would happen next.

As Farty ate more and more food, he started to feel very full and a little bit gassy. But Farty wasn't worried, he knew that his body was just doing what it was supposed to do. With a whoosh and a toot, Farty let out a fart.

Everyone around him started to laugh and giggle, but Farty didn't mind. He was proud of his farts and loved to see others happy. So, he continued on his journey, spreading joy and giggles wherever he went.

Farty visited farms and jungles, and even went to the moon. Everywhere he went, he let out his famous farts and made all the animals and creatures smile.

But Farty's journey was not over yet. One day, he discovered a dark and gloomy place where no one was happy. The creatures there were all sad and grumpy, and Farty knew he had to help.

So, he let out the biggest fart of all, and suddenly the place was filled with laughter and smiles. Farty had saved the day and brought happiness back to the land.

From that day on, Farty continued to travel and spread joy and laughter wherever he went. And he learned that farts may be a little bit stinky, but they can bring happiness and laughter to those around us.

The end.","['Absolutely loved it 😂', 'Embarrassed to say I laughed out loud at some of this. Farty the fart, the little fart that could be.']",Learn Python as FAST as possible with ChatGPT,Python Programmer,2023-01-31T11:24:38Z,118806

But you don't become 'fluent' in a matter of months as in speaking like a native. It takes many years to become near to fluent. With respect, I wanted to mainly ask  if you would consider altering your stance on grammar and let people choose if they think it's important or not. It's not difficult and how you talk about it might make people think it's scary or hard or a total waste of time. 

I noticed that you described grammar as 'fluff' and 'nonsense'. In contrast, I believe it's a massive help when learning a language. I think you mean to say that you're not personally interested in understanding how language works, just how to say a few beginner phrases and sentences. That's cool. It's also really useful,  but it feels shortsighted to use derogatory words in connection with an important part of learning a foreign language. It's fine if someone doesn't feel up to grasping grammatical tools or doesn't want to, but there's no doubt that if you can, it's beneficial. You'd think someone had invented grammar with the purpose of pissing people off! It only exists to describe and therefore to help with language. It improves your language skills and your ability to use expressive language which is easy to understand. 

When you mention how we learn to speak, we learn a spoken language when we're little through listening, but learning a second language when you're much older is a totally different process. It's like saying that if someone can naturally sing beautifully when they're very young, there's zero point in learning to read music.

No offence as I love the fact you're promoting language-learning and introducing folk to chatgpt-- well done for that; I just wanted to make a few comments.","['Not true as far as becoming fluent in years.  I have met plenty of Africans who speak anywhere from 4 to 7 languages including English.

ZoXt2KahxXI,UgygHgkQI6MKGs_DARt4AaABAg,2022-12-20T20:52:06Z,4,"Thanks Frank, this addresses an issue I've been looking at lately regarding the use of AI by students to improve on their assignments and how do we deal with that in the classroom. I like the idea of changing which questions we ask, and how we ask them. This is why teachers ask for work to be shown sometimes!","['It certainly will be important to work around the technology and incorporate it into the assessments. \nOne observation I’ve made is that the AI cannot personalize or internalize the material - so asking questions that require a personal reflection on a topic (where appropriate) is one way to get genuine learning to occur.', 'From what i\'ve seen you have to help the AI Chat deduct down to the thing that you want so it hugely uses deductive reasoning to give it what you need, or what you ask for can be more simple just looking for information but then if people don\'t step up their game with the information they\'re providing on websites then you\'d have to tell it to find certain aspects that may not be mentioned or if there\'s anything else you may need to learn that isn\'t mentioned in the information or any websites you\'ve gone to and see if it can find something.\r\n\r\nFor the Bing Search Engine I had the idea to just search a list of concepts for something so that i could see everything i\'m learning to make sure i have all the information i need and i used fractions as an example which is a more complex concept than others in arithmetic which i\'ve been struggling to learn, so i used the Bing search that now uses AI and IT DID find a pretty darn close match to what i wanted and put it right at the top. \n\nBut i find it\'s better to use more than one search for sure i used ""list of concepts for fractions"" and it gave me the skills you need site at the top which is mostly useful but not as detailed as i\'d want, then i got a bit more specific and took ""for"" out of it searching ""list of concepts fractions"" and it gave me more stuff with summaries and the wikipedia page for a list of mathematics concepts at the bottom, but the byjus link at the top was also useful. It also put the study skills link in there too.\r\n\r\nSo you may want to run two or more searches with slightly different wording that means the same thing to get a few different results, or just get a little bit more specific with it using just keywords, i\'m already practised well enough at this because i still did this often anyway with google but now it looks like i will have to do it a lot more in order to try and get as close to what i was looking for as possible. Since the AI requires you to be more specific or now takes into account how things can mean several things that now makes the searches a bit more complex lol which i guess i love it gets you thinking a bit more about what you\'re searching for.']",Revolutionizing Education with ChatGPT: How AI is Transforming the Way We Learn,Learning and Technology with Frank,2022-12-20T20:06:10Z,20521
ZoXt2KahxXI,UgwGQ0g9_jChBzGylYl4AaABAg,2023-12-07T11:19:14Z,1,"The example you gave was very astute: The emphasis of ""Here is a problem/question: Give me the answer,"" approach in teaching due to ""league tables"" or ""examination grading"" has warped schools from places of learning into cohort-generation-factory-assortment of young people. Where a student is best at finding ""the path of least resistance"" to pass the criteria as opposed to improve themselves and their learning ability.

The emphasis on the learning process can be aided by AI then performance of individuals assessed and tailored or personalized learning implemented which is very different from standardized teaching for cohort-assortment as if humans are factory widgets churned out each year...

As such more emphasis might also be applied to human behaviour and regulation of the self aka self-development in people.",,Revolutionizing Education with ChatGPT: How AI is Transforming the Way We Learn,Learning and Technology with Frank,2022-12-20T20:06:10Z,20521

However the worries are unfounded because it will make mistakes, give tonnes of people the same essay or homework because it doesn't just create the information out of thin air... it takes information from the internet from ALL the information online including peoples views and opinions on things that won't reflect your take on things at all... the AI is only a product of what it can find and what it knows and cannot take into account the complexity if a human personality. 

There's also the fact that in a way it will make searches a bit more complex where something can mean multiple things not just one thing, so say you tell it ""Give me a video playing Latin music"" well if you don't specify it's going to give you something random, there's different types of Latin music and fast and slow speed too sooo... which do you want?, the same concept for other things that can mean different things too. So you have to start telling it more in order to help it narrow down to the thing you want it to do for you, people have already tried to write stories with the new Bing AI Chat but it's giving many people the same story then plagiarizing multiple different stories that already exists because it took things from other stories that were online lol so it cannot be used for stories and even poems well enough and they should probably scrap the idea of using it for that or for essays. 

You can use it to proof read and shorten down all your text for you though which i'm TOTALLY gonna use, but as i knew beforehand it's only really good for gathering information, proof reading, or maybe basic things like lists, scheduling, lesson plans, or something simple like writing an email for you, everything else will always be too complex for it because it's just a computer algorithm.

Picard and La Forge decide that computers cannot account for human intuition and elect to go with the manual approach😄\n\nIt seems it was educating me early how to work with AI software lol, but if there\'s anything i could recommend anyone to learn the gist of how it works is to watch Star Trek TNG or just that episode ""Booby Trap"" (hears giggles at the back of the class).

If you say something with really poor pronunciation a human can mentally work through what they think you might mean, using context and possibly a better understanding of you or of common mistakes made by language speakers with the same native language as you, and work out what you mean. GPT isn't that smart right now, and it will simply listen to a garbled word you said and interpret it phonetically with closest approximation. The more often that happens the less a meaningful conversation you'll have. That's true with a human language partner too, but humans are much better at understanding each other through other cues. We're running a much better algorithm than GPT when it comes to comprehension of others speaking our language, and for GPT's part that algorithm is hard to learn or imitate because it's a complex cocktail of communication skills including some that are linked to the real world.",,How To Learn Any Language For FREE Fast Using ChatGPT,Dr Alex Young,2023-06-25T07:00:16Z,200067

Chat gpt 3 had estimated 100 million users till date , 
+ Hype .

So now chat gpt 4 comes up 
20 $ for a monthly subscription.even if 1% of users sign up for just one month ..
That's 20 million in a month.

With the amount of promotion happening in YouTube for chat gpt 4 
One can imagine how much they gonna mint on this 😄👍🏻.

I also want to share my experience with ChatGPT as an English learner. I tend to use ChatGPT as a tool to correct my grammar mistakes, and I have found it very useful. I use it a lot, especially when I'm making comments in English on social media platforms. However, I have discovered something as soon as I started using ChatGPT to correct my grammar mistakes. It actually lowered my writing skills instead of improving them, because as human beings, we like to get results quickly. So, when you use ChatGPT, be aware and try to learn from your mistakes using the feedback it gives you, because that's how you can improve. If you just copy and paste without learning from your mistakes, it will negatively affect your English skills.","['Yes ☝️', 'point well made', 'Does this mean that AI will make us dumber in principle? 😄']",821.

Just to add to your amazing explanation about ChatGPT, you can use it by giving instructions instead of asking questions, and in this way, you can make it behave in a more 'human-like' manner. For example, the following prompt gave me a nice conversation with Ringo Starr:

I: ""Let's start a role-playing session. You are Ringo Starr from the Beatles. Don't respond as an AI language model, but only as Ringo Starr. How are you at the moment, Ringo?""
ChatGPT: ""Hey there mate, it's Ringo here! I'm feeling great today, thanks for asking. It's always a good day when I get to talk to fans of The Beatles. How about you, how are you doing?""

I: ""I'm fine, thanks. I'm a huge fan of the Beatles, and I was wondering how you felt when the Beatles broke up""
ChatGPT: ""Well, mate, it was definitely a tough time for all of us when The Beatles broke up. We had been together for so long and achieved so much together, it was hard to see it end. But at the same time, we all needed to move on and pursue our own interests and creative projects. It wasn't easy, but we remained good friends and always supported each other in our individual endeavors. And hey, the music we created together still lives on and continues to bring joy to people all over the world, so that's something to be proud of.""

I: ""Do you like football?""
ChatGPT: ""I'm a big fan of football, or soccer as it's known in some parts of the world. Growing up in Liverpool, football was a big part of our culture and I used to play a bit myself when I was younger. These days, I still enjoy watching matches and keeping up with the latest news and developments in the sport. In fact, I've even written a few songs about football over the years, like ""Liverpool 8"" and ""Anthem for the 21st Century."" So yeah, I definitely have a soft spot for the beautiful game.""

I: ""But, which is the correct term: football or soccer?""
ChatGPT: ""Well, that's a good question mate. In England, where I'm from, we call it football. But in other parts of the world, like the United States, it's called soccer. So both terms are correct, depending on where you are. However, as someone from Liverpool and a fan of the English Premier League, I tend to use the term football more often.""","['Fantastic.

Actually, Luke, I use it to improve my writing skills every day, but I'm also realizing that it is still learning and if I'm not good at writing first, its revised version is not so good, too.

Thank you for the amazing experience you share with us about puting questions to ChatGBT and concluding this systhem doesn’t have emotions neither preferences. We as humanity may be put in a dangerous situation if an AI systhem arrives to compete with human inteligence and so trying to submit humans … that would not be nice to human kind i presume! Besides this AI systhem does not promote human criticism. In fact the distinctions between fair and unfair seem not to be recognised by ChatGBT.

I found the section on the reasoning behind the grammar corrections particularly insightful. As a language learner, I often receive corrections without understanding why my original sentence was incorrect. This video has provided me with a new approach to learning and improving my English skills. While the AI language model may not be a perfect substitute for a human teacher, I appreciate that it is free and has the ability to identify and correct errors without teaching us bad habits. I believe that AI language models like this have their place in language education, but human teachers still play an essential role. I look forward to seeing how this technology evolves in the future, and I hope it will continue to complement human instruction rather than replace it.

Unfortunately, 4 years ago I became disabled due to my health complications from Diabetes and had to leave my teaching profession. I currently only teach online when my health is stable or I do not have any Doctor appointments.
 
I have always done and completed all my lesson plans, done research on my lessons, and performed all the duties required of a teacher. I can tell you that of all teacher duties, preparing weekly lesson plans, has always been the most dreadful of all tasks because of it being very time consuming while you have to differentiate instruction, utilize various instruction methodologies, and various manipulatives! 


This ChatGPT is going to explode in all markets and in all industries. Like everything else in our Industrial world, we will see many advances in AI to save time, money, while finding quicker solutions to doing and completing tasks. At the same time, those with an evil mind will also find ways in doing crime online.

ChatGPT has been very popular these days and I think it is a big revolution in the AI industry. Even though Chatgpt is gaining popularity, many people are still unsure about what this high-tech AI can do. Some people think this technology is nothing but an obstacle to language teaching since learners tend to abuse this technology. But on the other hand, there is a considerable amount of people who think chatGPT is a very helpful tool for educators to use in their material designing, creating contexts, preparing lesson plans and so on. Thanks for showing us how to use chatGPT to get good outlines, different and creative ideas and various examples in our classes. As educators know, teaching can be time-consuming, especially when it comes to preparing materials, lesson plans and in-class activities beforehand. It's great to see that Chatgpt can assist with these types of tasks, ultimately saving teachers time. This AI can improve our teaching material, provide feedback, generate ideas, and complete tasks more efficiently. It's important to note, however, that Chatgpt is not perfect and can make mistakes. Therefore, I think it's crucial for teachers who have been in the field for a while to receive proper training to take full advantage of these opportunities.

The integration of AI in education has been a game-changer, providing teachers with tools to automate some of the more mundane tasks, freeing them up to focus on what they do best: teaching. This can help to reduce stress levels, and allow teachers to form stronger bonds with their students. By automating tasks like creating reading comprehension worksheets and grading papers, teachers can focus on developing their lesson plans and making the most of classroom time. While AI may eliminate some of the paperwork from a teacher's daily routine, it's important to note that the actual planning and delivery of lessons are still done by teachers. AI is simply a tool to assist them in creating a more efficient and effective learning experience. By taking care of the tedious tasks like making PowerPoints and filling out lesson plan templates, teachers can spend more time inspiring their students and making learning more enjoyable. By doing these tasks, teachers can focus on what matters most: creating a dynamic and engaging classroom environment. With AI technology at their disposal, teachers can spend more time preparing innovative and interactive activities that foster a love of learning. The possibilities are endless, and we can only imagine the impact that AI will continue to have on education in the years to come","[""Hi Spicy, thank you for your comment.

Teachers can use ChatGPT to create more efficient and effective learning experiences, while reducing stress levels and forming stronger bonds with their students.

The same could be said about many videos on the internet explaining grammatical rules, there can always be more to it, depending on how deep you want to dive into those subjects.  Of course, it lacks things, fortunately enough we can still, as humans, provide others with information in a more detailed way, which means we aren't yet dispensable. Still, your claim about 'Spanish not using pronouns to indicate subjects' is actually wrong, no matter how emphatically you stated the contrary. We drop the pronouns in many cases, not all of them, so by giving incomplete information you're misleading others the same way you claim the chat does. Btw, it's not such a big deal if you add the pronouns at the beginning.","['There were mistakes in the basics actually - and Spanish is pro-drop, so I don\'t see how pronouns can indicate subjects (they are dropped most of the time, so of course, it\'s the verb endings that take on that role). The thing about estar and ""temporary"" states is totally wrong. Don\'t even get me started on how terribly wrong it was about Bulgarian... It didn\'t correct my obviously wrong use of the subjunctive. The only language it did well in was Italian. I don\'t see how that\'s cherry picking.', ""\u200b@@PolyglotSecretsYes, you said it right this time, most of the time, still, that IS, in fact, one of their functions, to substitute or indicate subject in a sentence, so saying that that is 'pure wrong' is factually wrong, particularly considering two pronouns share the same conjugation, plain and simple. You're admitting to not even being sure of what the correct way to say certain things in Spanish is, which is not a bad thing, but you're being just as confusing as the chat, which is the point that I was making.

In my opinion, this is like if I say that I am faster walking than riding a bike... without disclosing the fact that I don't know how to ride a bike, my point is, ChatGPT is just a tool, and you need to learn how to use it. 
And just in the first 5 minutes of this video I can tell you don't know how to use this properly, you ask for basic grammar, and it gives some generalized basic grammar, then you complain that it's not in dept enough, and you are right, it's not, because that is not what you asked for.

However, it\'s not just ""not in depth"" - in all languages, it spit up things which were completely wrong. That\'s the problem.

I expected much more from ChapGPT in that regard, because it\'s so good in other fields.

Definitely it gets things wrong, but I think one discussion is whether you should trust the information it gives you, and another discussion is whether it's effective in helping to learn languages.

I'm sure most people would use it as one tool in a language learning toolkit, but the best use seems to be having an on-demand conversation partner in many languages. Really great for organic, natural, and sometimes memorable comprehensible input. Excellent for speech practice too since you could use voice typing to send the messages during a conversation. It's something that's always willing to talk, doesn't judge your mistakes, and is eager to help you improve. All at the pace you need, since you can ask it what things mean and other clarification or elaboration. 

Overall, I would compare it among how humans perform at the same tasks. Even if some of the things it mentioned here weren't correct or only partially correct, it's still more than most people could provide. And everyday speakers make mistakes too; I think we all have at least one memory of something we mis-learned in a language from another person.

Language learning and teaching is after all a cognitive process involving human emotions and even facial expressions, and direct interaction and comms between students and teachers which Chatgpt is lacking. its translation is very good and at times can be better than google, but still the end result needs human input and editing. Its behaviour is still robotic to begin with. Secondly it cannot do ""interactive audio"" in real time which is an essential part of the learning process. It has standard almost identical answers for pretty much everything even if you rephrase the question or query, which I did, and it can also be inconsistent.

Also, I haven't tested this program yet. I am a little afraid of IA because of the following story: four weeks ago, at about 22 o'clock called my daughter. She had broken her SIM card and I should write a WhatsApp with the new number. Unfortunately, it was not really MY daughter. The next day I received messages for help. I should 1100€ transmit it right away to a special account. I wanted to call her with the new number, but only I could hear a ""bibbibi"". So I wrote her, she should come to me, then I will help her. Then she wrote, she had no time but the sound was rude and ruder from text to text. I was afraid, she is stepped into a trap
That's why, I didn't transmit the money. In the evening she came from the driver's lesson. I spoke whit her on my ex-wife's Telephone. She had never called me and the old cell number was ok.

(whether you have studied are familiar with or not). This is a fun opportunity to showcase your talent with a little bit of humility proving you too are human and still a language learner. You can put the flags of the 10 languages you choose for the challenge in both the thumbnail and the title and tag the video as #takingtheclozemaster 10 languages challenge. While also tagging the languages of the challenge. When choosing from a diverse variety of languages consider this, to include some of those you're familiar with, those that you are not, and those that you will later learn. Choosing to include a conlang like Interlingua and an ancient language like Latin will keep the challenge diverse while bringing recognition to these languages (you may surprise yourself). Consider getting a hold of Clozemaster they may be interested in sponsoring the video. We as a community of language Learners need a challenge that we can all appreciate and try together. To get the most out of the video challenge adjust the settings as follows: put the skills to listening, the question count to 10, and the mode to multiple choice. Then you can adjust the account to dark mode (as it's more attractive) and the default speed to 75% for better hearing the questions. Doing a dry run will ensure all the settings are correct. Keep a notepad by your side to keep track of the language scores. Before you end the video it would be nice if you encouraged other polyglots and language Learners to take up the challenge.\nBuenas suerte\nCarpe Diem \nالسلام عليكم""]",How To Learn ANY Language With These ChatGPT Prompts,AI Andy,2023-10-27T09:28:21Z,144611

The best thing about it is it can generate some word quiz that you can try to answer.

Or as a translator... At least it can do multiple translations at once. I learn French and Spanish, and when I use a normal translator, I have to manually change the language options to go back and forth between French and Spanish. But I can ask ChatGPT to translate it to French & Spanish at the same time.

Guess translator apps should be worried by this AI ...

And the flaws are : it doesn't have a built-in speaker that sounds like native. Some translator/language learning apps have better speakers. In translator app, you can at least replay/re-listen again in slow speed.

It's good for some of my needs, but I still wouldn't recommend this to people who seriously wants to learn languages. There are apps out there designed for language learning that included AI technology.

I call it working memory because no paper actually talk about it in details. But generally these model have limited token input based on the input size of the model, it's too small to follow a long chat log and remember things, so how does chat GPT does?

Well the first time an architecture of working memory was used was AI dungeon, what it did was simply put round of user input and ai answer in a list, then drop the older round. This lead to rambly ai who forget old details and can have huge mood swing in the middle of the conversation as semantic drift happen and data is lost. The network itself is basically a fancy function, the state is the input, if you change the input the state change.

The way Chat GPT handle long chat is simply by having an attention network go through the chat log based on the latest user input, rank data that are relevant, summarize them with a LLM, then concatenate the summary to the user input as a context state, this is a form of lossy compression. This why chat GPT has a global knowledge, but sometimes fails at local knowledge. The input takes a working memory data structure that has a initialization prompts + the summary of the chatlog relevant to the user input + the user input. Working memory innovation is key for this tech to progress.

The over issues chat GPT have is overfitting vs overgeneralization. Overfitting is generally seen as bad in ai, but in this case, we need selective overfitting, such that some data are memorized rather than generalized, for example, it often hallucinate function that don't exist in certain programming language, that's over generalizing, it understand that programming is composable but some part are exception that need to be memorized, like game boy asm don't have div instructions, shader.create(String shader) don't exist in unity3d, similarly some books or character don't exist but it makes them up by blending existing data, this is where overfitting on knowledge should be applied.","['Very insightful comment!  I have been trying to figure out their working memory approach for some time based on behaviour that seemed impossible given the input limit, as you mentioned.  I assumed it had something to do with a periodic parsing and a concatenated summary would explain why it seems to paraphrase details from earlier in the conversation, which leads to drift as the details are ""reinterpreted"".

Yes they added a reinforcement phase later as an auxiliary process to help refine the quality of the answers, but that is not the core model driving ChatGPT.

In ChatGPT's own words when I asked ""Is ChatGPT transformer based, or reinforcement learning based?"":

""Large language models like GPT-3, which are a type of transformer model, primarily use a form of machine learning called supervised learning, not reinforcement learning.

The specific algorithm used is called the Transformer architecture, which was introduced in a paper called ""Attention is All You Need"" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. The Transformer model uses a mechanism called self-attention (or sometimes called scaled dot-product attention) to weigh the importance of different words in an input sequence when generating an output sequence.

In the training process, these models are fed large amounts of text data. Each sentence in the training data is paired with the same sentence, but shifted one token (word or character) to the right. The model's task is to predict the next token given the previous ones, which is a form of supervised learning because it uses labeled training data (the correct next token is the label).

Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. It's commonly used in areas like game playing or robotics, where there's a clear feedback loop for the agent's actions. While there has been some research on using reinforcement learning for language models, it's not the primary method used in large transformer models like GPT-3.""","['They added RLHF later, and chatGPT have access to public information until 2021.

I've been experimenting with different ways of using it to learn. One thing I find that works best for getting a quick overview of things, particularly with more obscure things, is to just ask it to write a ""lesson 1"" tutorial on a topic (like using a library or something) and then ask it to list some other future topics I should explore. I then say write lesson #2 covering some other topic (or to elaborate on something in the first run)  It sometimes gets stuff wrong or does something weird, but I actually think that helps in the learning process. 

It frustrates me that a few people I know refuse to take advantage of it. At some point they received some nonsense response and for some weird reason they decided that was enough for them to completely write it off.

A transformer is a type of neural network architecture that is used in natural language processing. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which analyze language by processing words one at a time in sequential order, transformers use a combination of positional encodings, attention, and self-attention to efficiently process and analyze large sequences of text.

Neural networks, Convolutional neural networks (for image analysis), Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Positional encodings, Attention, Self-attention

Neural networks: A type of model used for analyzing complicated data, such as images, videos, audio, and text.
Convolutional neural networks: A type of neural network designed for image analysis.
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): A type of neural network used for text analysis that processes words one at a time in sequential order.
Positional encodings: A method of storing information about word order in the data itself, rather than in the structure of the network.
Attention: A mechanism used in neural networks to selectively focus on parts of the input.
Self-attention: A type of attention mechanism that allows the network to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.

Neural networks are like a computerized version of a human brain, that uses algorithms to analyze complex data.
Convolutional neural networks are used for tasks like identifying objects in photos, similar to how a human brain processes vision.
Recurrent neural networks are used for text analysis, and are like a machine trying to understand the meaning of a sentence in the same order as a human would.
Positional encodings are like adding a number to each word in a sentence to remember its order, like indexing a book.
Attention is like a spotlight that focuses on specific parts of the input, like a person paying attention to certain details in a conversation.
Self-attention is like being able to pay attention to multiple parts of the input at the same time, like listening to multiple conversations at once.","['Great, you learned how to copy paste', '@@an-dr6eu first step on becoming a programmer', ""\u200b@@an-dr6eu your comment comes over somewhat 'catty' 😢""]","Transformers, explained: Understand the model behind GPT, BERT, and T5",Google Cloud Tech,2021-08-18T23:00:16Z,858491

SZorAJ4I-sA,UgwWeJs9uMvg_jgeaiF4AaABAg,2022-05-19T18:10:48Z,16,"The invention of transformers seems to have jump-started a revolutionary acceleration in machine learning! Between the models you mentioned here, plus the way transformers are combined with other network architectures in DALL-E 2, OpenAI Jukebox, PaLM, Chinchilla/Flamingo, Gato -- it seems like adding a transformer to any model produces bleeding-edge, state-of-the-art-or-better performance on basically any tasks.

Barring any major architecture innovations in the future, I wonder if transformers end up being the key we need to reach human levels of broad-range performance after all 🤔","['@Dino Sauro They\'re certainly not dead, since they\'re still being incorporated into the bleeding edge AIs. But technology is always evolving, building upon one idea to create the next. If you\'re hoping for a ""final architecture"" that will be the best and never replaced by anything else, you\'re out of luck.\n\nWhile I respect Professor Marcus, his ideas about the requirements for AGI strongly imply that intelligent design is required for true intelligence to emerge, and I think evolution contradicts that view.', '@Dino Sauro Um... Okay, friend, whatever you say. Have a nice life.', 'I think you are right...we just saw its use in ChatGPT...and I think ChatGPT is just a glimpse of what future holds and how it will affect the IT, EV and Industrial Automation Industry.\n\nAm I right? You wanna add something to it?', '@@tanweeralam1650 I agree. ChatGPT, though, is really just GPT-3 with a larger input layer, and human-guided reinforcement learning on top of it. Which is a step in the right direction for sure, but not as huge a development as a lot of people are touting it to be.\n\nFrom what I can tell, there are three issues that need to be solved before transformer-based (or transformer-incorporating) AIs can reach truly human levels of intelligent behavior.\n\n(1) They need to be bigger. If we think of the model parameter size as analogous to brain synapses, there are about a quadrillion synapses in a human brain, which is orders of magnitude more than the biggest current transformers. For instance, the largest single transformer model is 207 billion parameters, and the largest transformer-incorporating language model is 1.75 trillion parameters. On the other hand, such models don\'t need to allocate parameters for things like body maintenance, reproduction, etc., so it\'s not a 1-to-1 correspondence, but I think it\'s a good estimate for the order of magnitude we need to reach before we get to human levels of sapience. That said, models keep getting bigger, so I have no doubt we\'ll achieve this within the next decade at most.\n\n(2) Multimodality is important. A lot of ""common sense"" understanding that AIs seem to lack can likely be attributed to their lack of variety in types of input they can learn from. If you only learn from text, it\'s a lot harder to learn what the described concepts actually *mean.* On the other hand, a model that can learn from text, images, video, audio, and other forms of data should be able to learn much more accurate representations of the world. And of course, there\'s a TON of research into multimodal learning right now, so we\'ll get there pretty soon, too, I think.\n\n(3) The third obstacle I think is the hardest: continual learning. (From what I can tell, by the way, ""continual learning"" is synonymous with ""incremental online learning"". Let me know if there are any important differences between the two.) An AI without this can learn from a *ton* of data, but once it does, it stops learning and everything it knows is set in stone. In effect, this means every interaction with such an AI ""resets"" it, and so you might get inconsistent behaviors as slightly different initial conditions of an interaction can lead to very different outputs when previous similar interactions are not incorporated into the model\'s weights (which, in this context, can be thought of as its ""long term memory""). This also means the AIs can\'t form consistent opinions, since any opinion they might espouse in one conversation is immediately forgotten for the next.\n\nContinual learning techniques already exist for smaller networks, but they are not at all efficient enough to practically apply to these very large language models of many billions of parameters or more. Which is a shame, because I\'d speculate that larger models would be less prone to retroactive interference -- ""catastrophic forgetting"" -- than smaller ones, if we could efficiently incrementally train them.', ""@@IceMetalPunk I did understand your first 2 points and agree with it...but I want to slightly differ with your 3rd point.\n\nI dont understand...Why would the AI would stop learning?? Due to its storage space, Processing power exhaustion or for what reason? What you said may be a POSSIBILITY...But its others side also exists...it may just continue learning more n more and make it's system better.\n\nTo have Human like Intelligence...I dont think it will achieve that in next 30-40 yrs...far from those timeline...I can't say. And frankly there is NO NEED to have AIs so Advanced. Upto a certain extent...AIs should develop and Humans MUST BE able to control them. Always.\n\nAnd can you say will Programs like ChatGPT ( i mean its advanced form) able to replace search Engine like Google in future?? Also how AI/ML will affect IT industry as a whole and also EV, Industrial Automation industry (e.g.- the industry where companies like Siemens, Honeywell operate)??""]","Transformers, explained: Understand the model behind GPT, BERT, and T5",Google Cloud Tech,2021-08-18T23:00:16Z,858491

For example, in another video by another YouTuber I heard the sentiment that being an AI person in this era means constant - really constant - study.  That may not be the lifestyle that everybody wants to adopt.  I'm a retired neurologist and vice president of the faculty club at my state university.  What interests me these days is how students ""should"" be educated in this era.  And, at the end of the day, one of the critical aspects of that is matching individual human brains - with their individual proclivities - with the endless career opportunities of this era.  So, I'm trying to gather perspectives (aka ""data"") on that topic.  Maybe you could make some kind of video about it.  Please do!","[""I think the most important thing is that students are simply encouraged to use these tools. It's pretty hard to get a realistic grasp of the capabilities without really pushing the systems. The idea about needing to do constant research is interesting, and I think it's something that a person CAN do (the rest of my life probably lmao) but I think simply adopting the tools is all that will effectively matter. It's too early to be much more specific sadly.
