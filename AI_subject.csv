China and Japan realize this and have their children at the front of the line.  It is best to start early.  My stem education started early in about the third grade.  We built model airplanes and flew them during recess.  We also built electromagnets, and other such science projects.  We had regular science shows come to the school.   My favorite was the crystal radio which actually worked.  From there I was hooked on electronics.  This in turn lead me to become a federally licensed Radio/Telecommunications Engineer.  I enjoyed a very rewarding career.","['I\'ll have to disagree on this one Roger.  Although the Chinese start early in STEM (I will not comment on the Japanese here) their graduates often lack the ability to think ""Out of the box\'.  In my time (25+years in radio/telco engineering) I have interviewed many Chinese candidates often with \'Masters\' qualifications only to find that when thrown a \'real life curve ball problem\' they lack the capacity critically and creativity think and solve problems i.e when posed with practical radio propagation challenges they are all to quick to cite Maxwell, Rayleigh or Okumura-Hata yet miss the the real life/operational implications, solutions or considerations.  My jury is well and truely out on the Chinese (and Indian) educational systems, they appear to be very transmissionist in nature thus lacking many of the constructivist properties such as those detailed a time 00:50 of this video:)']",STEM Education Overview,BBHCSD Media,2014-04-16T19:59:53Z,681821

Please answer,"['In my humble opinion, I think that Music lessons can also be great for STEAM. From what I\'ve read, the ""A"" in STEAM stands for the Liberal Arts (which are the more social-humanistic disciplines, let\'s say) and that include Music. Besides, Music can be easily linked to the rest of the STEAM disciplines. Think for example in the basic unit of Music, the sound. What is sound? From a scientific perspective, sounds are waves. Just imagine trying to create instruments or something like that for deaf people to be able to enjoy music, for example. That could be a nice project if well developed. It would be linked to real life and thus have a practical sense, and it could imply STEAM, PBL, Inquiry-Based Learning (if starting with a question like ""can deaf people enjoy music/how do deaf people perceive music?"". I think this could be an option, bit I strongly believe Music offers much more possibilities regarding STEAM.

I have always done and completed all my lesson plans, done research on my lessons, and performed all the duties required of a teacher.

ChatGPT has been very popular these days and I think it is a big revolution in the AI industry. Even though Chatgpt is gaining popularity, many people are still unsure about what this high-tech AI can do. Some people think this technology is nothing but an obstacle to language teaching since learners tend to abuse this technology. But on the other hand, there is a considerable amount of people who think chatGPT is a very helpful tool for educators to use in their material designing, creating contexts, preparing lesson plans and so on. Thanks for showing us how to use chatGPT to get good outlines, different and creative ideas and various examples in our classes. As educators know, teaching can be time-consuming, especially when it comes to preparing materials, lesson plans and in-class activities beforehand. It's great to see that Chatgpt can assist with these types of tasks, ultimately saving teachers time. This AI can improve our teaching material, provide feedback, generate ideas, and complete tasks more efficiently. It's important to note, however, that Chatgpt is not perfect and can make mistakes. Therefore, I think it's crucial for teachers who have been in the field for a while to receive proper training to take full advantage of these opportunities.

By automating tasks such as grading, teachers can spend more time providing personalized feedback and support to students, fostering a more engaging and effective learning experience.

Additionally, reducing the amount of rote work can help alleviate teacher burnout and allow them to maintain their passion for teaching."", '@@spicy4919 I strongly concur that the use of AI tools such as automated grading systems can greatly alleviate the burden on teachers and give them more time to concentrate on valuable interactions with students.

Furthermore, reducing the amount of repetitive work can ease teacher burnout and enable them to sustain their enthusiasm for teaching.', 'Genuine question, how do you feel about students transferring to AI the more mundane and rote work of summarising texts and writing up essays, which gives them more time to listen, debate, think critically etc?  I think the whole approach to teaching and assessing students will need to change, requiring far more direct interaction between students and teachers because, lets face it, chat-GPT is already more than capable of being a top ranking student and quite likely is already more capable at teaching (in the traditional sense), than many teachers.  \n\nMany respected and highly paid knowledge based roles will rapidly shrink or disappear in the coming years (300m jobs the first estimate), such as lawyers, researchers, graphic designers, coders, even doctors, to name but a few, so teaching will also be impacted, unless there are significant changes to old-school schooling.']",ChatGPT for Teachers - Doing an hour of work in 6 MINUTES!,Ted Pickett,2023-01-06T11:25:42Z,197092

The class was still planned by the teacher, selecting the text, choosing an appropriate range and style of classroom activity. And the actual classroom delivery is still done by teachers. 

If AI can do 90% of the teachers work, it just means that 90% of the teacher's work is timewasting paperwork that can and should be automated. Making PowerPoints and grading worksheets - gone. Grammar checking for essays -0- gone. Filling out lesson plan and unit planning templates, expunged.

You emphasized the potential benefits of artificial intelligence-powered technologies for educators well. Chat GPT makes not only the students but also teachers encouraged to use itself by serving its benefits to us. AI may free up teachers‚Äô time to focus on more rewarding parts of teaching, such as motivating and engaging students. I think it is crucial to highlight that AI cannot entirely replace human teachers in the classroom. While AI can assist with some activities, it lacks the creativity, sensitivity, and intuition that human teachers bring to the classroom. Teachers are crucial in creating a great learning environment, developing relationships with students. However, it is important to understand the risks and limitations of ChatGPT. There is a concern that excessive automation would lead to a lack of creativity and diversity in teaching methodologies, resulting in poor student learning outcomes.

They require a solution that minimizes their energy expenditure. ChatGPT provides an effective solution to this issue, making it easier and quicker for teachers to start and finish projects. With this program, they can access detailed writings, projects, and more, that are tailored to meet the requirements of a professional teacher. Additionally, it caters to the needs of different students, providing personalized content and leading them to success. This elite planning and scheming tool can easily create detailed work while transforming dull and tedious work into a fun and exciting task. By using ChatGPT, teachers can build stronger relationships with their students and avoid spending hours completing exhausting work.

Of course this doesn't mean that they will just copy paste the materials or activities from ChatGPT all the time. They should still try to come up with original and enjoyable activities time to time but they can get some help from the AI. As you have shown in the video the teachers can get some help on activities or questions about a specific book which is probably so much faster then actually doing it. Or you can create an activity yourself but you can ask ChatGPT to turn it into a differentiated activity for some specific students in your class which will help the students at understanding.

Erica Martin, an English and reading tutor, shared how she uses ChatGPT to create reading comprehension worksheets for her students. Another commenter, Ek, asked for clarification on the concept of Lexie level 300 and how it can be used for EFL classes with 11th and 12th graders.

Spicy commented on how AI in education has been a game-changer, allowing teachers to automate tedious tasks and focus on teaching. Teachers can use ChatGPT to create more efficient and effective learning experiences, while reducing stress levels and forming stronger bonds with their students. However, it's important to note that AI should not be considered a replacement for human teachers, as they bring unique knowledge, experience, and creativity to the classroom. The most effective teaching tactics will likely involve a combination of human and AI-powered technologies to provide students with the best possible learning experience.

Emir T√ºrkeli also praised ChatGPT for its ability to transform mundane and boring work into quick and fun tasks. The tool allows teachers to specify their way of teaching and form strong bonds with their students. Nazlƒ±can Etce agreed that ChatGPT can assist with relieving regular and time-consuming duties for teachers, allowing them to focus on providing students with human knowledge, experience, and creativity. However, they emphasized that the relationship between teacher and student is important for the learning process, and AI language models should not be considered a replacement for human teachers.",,ChatGPT for Teachers - Doing an hour of work in 6 MINUTES!,Ted Pickett,2023-01-06T11:25:42Z,197092

This applies directly to AI models as well when it comes to teaching. In real world, majority of teachers just cannot pay individual attention and cannot possibly cater the specific needs of a single student. But with AI, it is very much possible.

pmzZF2EnKaA,UgzypCvuQYmvqX_fQCh4AaABAg,2023-06-01T18:49:28Z,10,"I provided your formula to chatgpt to improve upon it . Here's how the conversaion went. What do you think?

I am learning how to write better prompts and i have came across this formula ""[Context] + [Specific Information] + [Intent/Goal] + [Response Format (if needed)] = Perfect Prompt"" , Could you tell me if it's a perfect prompt or something can be improved in it? Give it to me in a simple paragraph.

ChatGPT
The formula you mentioned for writing a perfect prompt is a useful guideline, but there is always room for improvement to ensure clarity and effectiveness. Let's break it down:

Context: Setting the context provides the necessary background information to understand the topic or situation. It helps orient the reader or respondent.
Specific Information: Including specific details helps narrow down the focus of the prompt and provides clear guidelines for the response.
Intent/Goal: Clearly stating the intent or goal of the prompt helps the reader understand the purpose and deliver a relevant response.
Response Format (if needed): If there are specific requirements or formats for the response, mentioning them ensures that the respondent knows how to structure their answer.
Overall, the formula captures important elements, but it's important to ensure that each component is well-defined and concise. It's also crucial to consider the audience and tailor the prompt accordingly. By refining these aspects, you can create a more effective prompt that elicits clear and relevant responses.

User
Can something else be added to make it more perfect? If yes, please add it and provide the new formula

ChatGPT
Certainly! To further enhance the effectiveness of the prompt, you can consider incorporating the following element:

Desired Outcome: Including the desired outcome explicitly communicates what the ideal response should achieve or address. It helps guide the respondent towards the intended objective.

By adding the Desired Outcome component, the formula for a more comprehensive and effective prompt becomes:

[Context] + [Specific Information] + [Intent/Goal] + [Desired Outcome] + [Response Format (if needed)] = Perfect Prompt

This revised formula ensures that the respondent not only understands the context, specifics, intent, and format requirements but also has a clear understanding of the expected outcome. This clarity helps to align the response with the intended objective and encourages a more focused and relevant response.

User
Please provide an example using the new formula you provided and also break it down

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's create an example prompt using the revised formula:

Formula: [Context] + [Specific Information] + [Intent/Goal] + [Desired Outcome] + [Response Format (if needed)] = Perfect Prompt

Example Prompt:

[Context] You are a tour guide in a historic city and have just encountered a group of tourists.

[Specific Information] One of the tourists asks about the significance of a particular monument.

[Intent/Goal] Explain the historical importance of the monument and its cultural impact on the city.

[Desired Outcome] Provide a detailed response that highlights key historical events related to the monument and elucidates its significance to the city's heritage.

[Response Format (if needed)] Please organize your response into three paragraphs: Introduction, Historical Background, and Cultural Impact.

Breaking down the example prompt:

Context: You are a tour guide in a historic city and have just encountered a group of tourists.
Specific Information: One of the tourists asks about the significance of a particular monument.
Intent/Goal: Explain the historical importance of the monument and its cultural impact on the city.
Desired Outcome: Provide a detailed response that highlights key historical events related to the monument and elucidates its significance to the city's heritage.
Response Format (if needed): Please organize your response into three paragraphs: Introduction, Historical Background, and Cultural Impact.
By including all these components, the prompt provides clear instructions to the respondent. They understand the context of the scenario, know which specific information to address, comprehend the intent and goal of the prompt, have a clear understanding of the desired outcome, and are aware of the expected response format. This comprehensive prompt enables the respondent to provide a well-structured and informative response that aligns with the intended objective.",,I Discovered The Perfect ChatGPT Prompt Formula,Skill Leap AI,2023-05-18T20:15:45Z,902991

The effectiveness of a prompt depends on various factors, including the complexity of the task, the capabilities of the language model, and the clarity of your communication.

Including context: Providing relevant context helps the model understand the background of your question or request. It can be crucial for getting accurate and appropriate responses.

Specific information: Being specific about what you're looking for helps narrow down the scope of the response and increases the chances of getting the desired information. Including relevant details can be beneficial in guiding the model's understanding.

Intent: Clearly stating your intention or what you're seeking from the model helps set expectations and allows the model to provide more targeted responses. It's important to express your intent in a concise and explicit manner.

Response format: If you have a specific format or type of response in mind, mentioning it in your prompt can be helpful. For instance, if you prefer step-by-step explanations or examples, requesting them explicitly can guide the model's response.

However, it's important to note that while these elements can improve the quality of the responses, the model's output can still vary due to the inherent limitations of language models. It's always a good idea to review and verify the information provided by the model and exercise critical thinking when evaluating its responses.",,I Discovered The Perfect ChatGPT Prompt Formula,Skill Leap AI,2023-05-18T20:15:45Z,902991

It's exciting to think we can focus on the more human aspects of teaching, but then how many more students am I able to teach? If I go from 100 to 200, do I know each of them individually? If I don't grade their papers, I have to look at the AI generated feedback to see where maybe the problem is, can I be a mentor and not just a cheerleader? Many, many things need to be thought about, will a student who is almost only trained individually be able to connect to other people who share almost no cultural references with that student? I think we barely understand the science behind the development of young brains into mature brains capable of metacognition, who will decide how much ""individual"" instruction is best for the student and what should be in it? Should a young child be allowed to pick only the topics of interest to them? Could they opt out of topics they do not like? What is that going to look like when these young people need to earn a living? What will higher education mean when you can't really decide what degree that student has and what are the topics and skills they have acquired?  Education has important individual consequences, but also huge social repercussions. So far, I haven't heard many arguments made about how AI is going to make everyone able to function as a member of society.

Data quality: Generative AI requires large amounts of high-quality training data to learn from. If the training data is of low quality or biased, the generative AI model may produce inaccurate or biased results.
Overfitting: Generative AI models can overfit the training data, meaning that they become too specialized in reproducing the training data and fail to generalize to new data.
Understanding context: While generative AI can produce data that resembles the training data, it may not always understand the context of the data or be able to interpret it accurately.
Limited creativity: While generative AI can produce new data, it is still limited in its creativity compared to human imagination.
Computational power: Some generative AI models require significant computational power to train and run, which may limit their accessibility to some applications.

They made the point that, when you really think about it, it's surprising that chatGPT is as good at arithmetic as it is, simply because it wasn't _designed_ to do arithmetic.  Sure, calculators and calculator apps can do arithmetic problems nearly instantly and with nearly 100% accuracy (""nearly"" because there's always some small probability that _something_ goes wrong, such as the famous video where a particular TI calculator erroneously gives an answer to a random arithmetic problem in terms of œÄ), but they were specifically _designed_ to do that.  ChatGPT and similar models, on the other hand, were designed to model _natural languages._  All they're _really_ doing is picking up on patterns in their training data and using those patterns to predict what the most likely output to a given input is.  So, that it can usually at least get _close_ to the right answers to arithmetic problems on large numbers, even though it's unlikely its training data contained a large amount of such problems, is surprising.  It says something about the similarities between the grammatical and syntactic rules of a natural language and the algorithmic rules of arithmetic that a tool designed to model the former can do reasonably well at the latter.","[""Yeah it's just a word predictor, it doesn't actually do any math."", '\u200b@@RemizZ ""it\'s just a word predictor"" can imply literally anything from a random generator to a human to a super intelligence.

If 2 plus 2 is 5 how much is 3 times 2


ChatGPT
If 2 plus 2 is considered to be 5, we are assuming an incorrect mathematical premise. In standard arithmetic, 2 plus 2 equals 4. Given that premise, if we multiply 3 by 2, the result would be 6. However, it's important to note that the initial premise of 2 plus 2 equaling 5 is incorrect in conventional mathematics.




User
But what would 3 times 2 be if 2 plus 2 is 5 is right

ChatGPT
If we assume the premise that 2 plus 2 equals 5, then we would calculate 3 times 2 accordingly.

Using that assumption, 3 times 2 would also be 5.




User
Why?

ChatGPT
If we assume the premise that 2 plus 2 equals 5, we are accepting a false statement. In this hypothetical scenario, we are redefining the basic arithmetic operations.

Since we have redefined addition to yield 5 when 2 plus 2 is calculated, we would apply the same redefined rules to multiplication. According to this hypothetical scenario, if we multiply 3 by 2, the result would be 5 as well.

However, it's important to note that in conventional mathematics, where 2 plus 2 equals 4, multiplying 3 by 2 would yield 6. The scenario where 2 plus 2 equals 5 is an example of a hypothetical situation that does not align with the standard rules of arithmetic.




User
Why wouldn‚Äôt it be 7.5?

ChatGPT
If we assume the premise that 2 plus 2 equals 5, and we multiply 3 by 2 using that assumption, the result would be 5, not 7.5.

In this hypothetical scenario, we are redefining the basic arithmetic operations. Addition has been redefined such that 2 plus 2 equals 5. If we apply this redefined addition to multiplication, we would treat it as repeated addition.

So, 3 times 2 would be equivalent to adding 3, two times. According to the assumption, adding 3 two times would yield 5. Therefore, in this specific hypothetical scenario, 3 times 2 would be 5.

However, it's important to reiterate that this scenario is not consistent with the standard rules of arithmetic. In conventional mathematics, where 2 plus 2 equals 4, multiplying 3 by 2 would yield 6.",,Why Is ChatGPT Bad At Math?,SciShow,2023-06-06T21:00:19Z,149184

It is also unable to keep a tally of the score which means it can't even do basic counting in many cases.
It messes up summaries, often missing key parts of the chat.
It can generate questions and answers that are totally wrong, it can't understand humour very well, or ambiguity (probably because it often sees ambiguity as spelling mistakes then answers based on the correction).
It has a lot of flaws, this is GPT-4 btw, everything it says should be taken with a pinch of salt, so you need to verify its responses, either by your own personal knowledge or by Googling it.
It is very worrying because I believe that a lot of people take a lot of what it outputs as actual fact, it is basically brainwashing people who see it as a tool, instead of what it actually is, A TECH DEMO with a lot of unknown limitations.

I like the idea of changing which questions we ask, and how we ask them. This is why teachers ask for work to be shown sometimes!","['It certainly will be important to work around the technology and incorporate it into the assessments. \nOne observation I‚Äôve made is that the AI cannot personalize or internalize the material - so asking questions that require a personal reflection on a topic (where appropriate) is one way to get genuine learning to occur.', 'From what i\'ve seen you have to help the AI Chat deduct down to the thing that you want so it hugely uses deductive reasoning to give it what you need, or what you ask for can be more simple just looking for information but then if people don\'t step up their game with the information they\'re providing on websites then you\'d have to tell it to find certain aspects that may not be mentioned or if there\'s anything else you may need to learn that isn\'t mentioned in the information or any websites you\'ve gone to and see if it can find something.\r\n\r\nFor the Bing Search Engine I had the idea to just search a list of concepts for something so that i could see everything i\'m learning to make sure i have all the information i need and i used fractions as an example which is a more complex concept than others in arithmetic which i\'ve been struggling to learn, so i used the Bing search that now uses AI and IT DID find a pretty darn close match to what i wanted and put it right at the top. \n\nBut i find it\'s better to use more than one search for sure i used ""list of concepts for fractions"" and it gave me the skills you need site at the top which is mostly useful but not as detailed as i\'d want, then i got a bit more specific and took ""for"" out of it searching ""list of concepts fractions"" and it gave me more stuff with summaries and the wikipedia page for a list of mathematics concepts at the bottom, but the byjus link at the top was also useful. It also put the study skills link in there too.\r\n\r\nSo you may want to run two or more searches with slightly different wording that means the same thing to get a few different results, or just get a little bit more specific with it using just keywords, i\'m already practised well enough at this because i still did this often anyway with google but now it looks like i will have to do it a lot more in order to try and get as close to what i was looking for as possible. Since the AI requires you to be more specific or now takes into account how things can mean several things that now makes the searches a bit more complex lol which i guess i love it gets you thinking a bit more about what you\'re searching for.']",Revolutionizing Education with ChatGPT: How AI is Transforming the Way We Learn,Learning and Technology with Frank,2022-12-20T20:06:10Z,20521

Where a student is best at finding ""the path of least resistance"" to pass the criteria as opposed to improve themselves and their learning ability.

The emphasis on the learning process can be aided by AI then performance of individuals assessed and tailored or personalized learning implemented which is very different from standardized teaching for cohort-assortment as if humans are factory widgets churned out each year...

However the worries are unfounded because it will make mistakes, give tonnes of people the same essay or homework because it doesn't just create the information out of thin air... it takes information from the internet from ALL the information online including peoples views and opinions on things that won't reflect your take on things at all... the AI is only a product of what it can find and what it knows and cannot take into account the complexity if a human personality. 

There's also the fact that in a way it will make searches a bit more complex where something can mean multiple things not just one thing, so say you tell it ""Give me a video playing Latin music"" well if you don't specify it's going to give you something random, there's different types of Latin music and fast and slow speed too sooo... which do you want?, the same concept for other things that can mean different things too.

You can use it to proof read and shorten down all your text for you though which i'm TOTALLY gonna use, but as i knew beforehand it's only really good for gathering information, proof reading, or maybe basic things like lists, scheduling, lesson plans, or something simple like writing an email for you, everything else will always be too complex for it because it's just a computer algorithm.

While it is true that AI can perform certain tasks faster and more efficiently than humans, it is important to remember that it is still a tool and does not have the ability to think for itself or make decisions on its own. It is up to humans to use AI responsibly and to continue to cultivate critical thinking skills. It is important to recognize that AI is a technology and does not have the same characteristics as a religion. While it may be tempting to view AI as a force that is beyond human control, it is important to remember that it is a product of human ingenuity and that we have the ability to shape its development and use.
Overall, the potential impacts of AI on society are complex and multifaceted. It is important to consider both the potential benefits and challenges of this technology and to approach its development and use with caution and care.","['This video is not for people who are able to think.', ""That comment sounds like it was written by OpenAI lol It has that distinct style of talking. \n\nWe know it will be the bosses of companies that install AI to replace employees, not the AI themselves. Just as we know guns don't make themselves or fire themselves. People will blame the AI before they blame the companies that use them. But let's think, how many use Amazon, how many use self-service tills, how many use ATMs instead of going into their bank, how many use online shopping rather than wonder around town? People don't consider other's employment, only their own. If they did we wouldn't see any homeless people on our streets. AI will be used to replace jobs because business is not a charity, their function is to make money, if they can use AI it will save them thousands in wages, of course they will do it.  There won't be any caution or care. There will be a lot of unemployed people. This won't be the first time progress has disturbed progress. Look at the miners riots when the mines were shut down when central heating was invented. What about all the horse breeders before cars were invented, what happened to them? Detroit is a famous example of businesses disrupting people's lives and not caring. Because that is how business works, its not personal, its about making money for themselves personally lol\nPeople will have to adapt and find something else to do. But its silly to suggest that businesses will have to be cautious and care because they won't, for them its all about profits. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think AI is amazing and if it can do the job better, as a customer that is what we want.

That idea was more or less disproven as electrical patterns observed under live MRI scans showed equal activity in both hemispheres regardless of whether a person recalled truthful data or created fabrications. At least that was one of the studies I was familiar with.  However that isn\'t to say that, different parts of the brain don\'t actually have different functions and that one hemisphere couldn\'t hold a function the other couldn\'t. The ability to speak is usually reserved to the hemisphere that contains both Wernicke\'s Area and Broca\'s Area which for most people is located on the left hemisphere, meaning the right side of the body reserves the ability of speech. In corpus callosum surgery where the hemispheres are separated, the left side of the body is observed to be mute. Since it can no longer instantly communicate with the other hemisphere, it will often ""disagree"" with its other side. I don\'t know if I would go as far as to say they are separate entities after separation as Grey suggests, but Left/Right brain specialization, at least in this context, is a valid and recognized phenomenon.

I made those decisions simultaneously. When I think back, I have two memories.

The reason this is happening is because both halves need to coordinate your decisionmaking. Splitting this ability in half makes you do more than one decision. If the theory of two personalities was real there would be more signs than were actually explained. There is a lot in this video going unspoken. The theory i say is widely accepted as the reason as there is no sign of a second personality inside other than different decisions. They may seem odd to the person who experiences it because they conciousness is able to grasp only one idea at a time. Its much like thinming. Try to think about two things at the same time. Impossible isnt it? Splitting your brain allows you for that but you dont really have the ability to use both halves separately due to the way the whole life you relied on it being whole. And by this unable to split your attention to both. Its like when you do a random thing and dont even understand why you did that. It happems often. Ever took spoon by mistake instead of a fork? Said something you did not want to? Its the same thing. Both halves having a idea but only one going throught. As complicated as our brain is there is not even a exact source of our conciousness or where it is set in the brain but trust me. If you say that there is two of you to anyone who works with this subject he will laugh. Brain is a complicated tool that works coordinated. Imagine your brain as a server. All data going through it both ways to coordinate it.

I understand that language and vocal muscles are controlled in wernicke's area, which is exclusively on the left side of the brain, but written and spoken language comprehension is shared between both hemispheres of the temporal lobe. Surely this ""silent brain"" would undoubtedly have some language skills it could use with one hand.","[""It's likely that the right brain is much like neglected children who never learned to people, it's spent it's years of plasticity doing work left brain can't do then handing it off through the connective tissue.

That's an interesting idea altogether. But I have to ask, what about long distance transportation? Without cars, everyone would have to move close to where they work. It will be much harder to go to a place that is around 100 miles away, and when you're trying to move to a new house, how do you move all those stuff? Do you carry all of them and walk all the way to your new house? What about ambulances? What if someone on a street passed out with a chronic disease and has to go to a hospital, do you carry them there? Cars are fairly essential for a city. Removing them may cause more problems than it solves. \n\nI'd rather have a city with cars and full of traffic and parking lots and garages and wide incompatible dangerous roads, than a city with no cars at all.

In second stage get only findings, merge them in one go (here 4.0 might be necessary) and ask to write either one paragraph summary with autors indication or few paragraphs - depending on needs.
